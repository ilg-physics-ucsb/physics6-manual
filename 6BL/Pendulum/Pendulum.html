<p>We will put a video here.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-setup">PART 1: SETUP</h2>
<p>The objective of this lab is to determine the physical quantities which influence the period of a pendulum. The period is how long it takes to make one complete cycle of motion. The relevant features are the mass of the bob, the length of the pendulum, and the initial angular displacement.</p>
<div class="ENumber">
<p>Exercise 1</p>
<div class="Exercise">
<ol type="a">
<li>Cut a reasonably long length of string, around 2m. Thread the string through the hole at the front of the horizontal rod, then tie it to the back of the top post. To adjust the length of the line, wrap it around the vertical post as shown in Picture 1.2. (Your lab may have a different setup. The TA will explain how to use the setup.)</li>

<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>Set the length to <strong>about</strong> 1 meter and use an initial displacement of 20 degrees. This angle starts from the string, now resting at 90 degrees, and is repositioned 20 degrees to the right or the left of the 90 degree mark. The 90-degree mark is actually zero degrees, the start of the angular measurement of the swing angle. See Picture 1.1. Try three different masses (bobs) keeping length and angular displacement fixed (constant). Perform two trials and calculate an average. Each trial consists of five complete periods for each mass.</p></li>
<li>Use small angles (5 to 20 degrees) and record the time for five complete periods. A complete period is the time it takes for the pendulum to swing back and forth. Then divide this number by five to obtain an average for one period. Record this data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Question 1</p>
<div class="Question">
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a data table showing each of the masses, the period for each trial, and the average period.</li>
<li>Does the period depend on mass?</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ENumber">
<p>Exercise 2</p>
<div class="Exercise">
<ol type="a">
<li>Keep the length consistent, and choose one of the bobs you just used. Experiment with different initial angular displacements. Try 5 degrees, then 10 degrees, then 15 degrees. Do two trials for each angle and calculate an average.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="QNumber">
<p>Question 2</p>
<div class="Question">
<ol type="a">
<li>Create another data table to include all data for each angle.</li>
<li>Does period depend upon the initial angular displacement?</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Conventional analysis of the pendulum is done for small angles, where the restoring force experienced by the bob is approximately linear with the displacement angle. Linear restoring force is one of the criteria for simple harmonic motion. When the displacement angles become large, the restoring force is no longer linear. The motion is still periodic, but it is not sinusoidal, and the mathematical analysis becomes far more involved.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-determining-the-mathematical-dependence">PART 2: DETERMINING THE MATHEMATICAL DEPENDENCE</h2>
<p>We will restrict our analysis to small angles. You should have found that the most significant factor influencing the period was the length of the pendulum. We would now like to figure out what the mathematical relationship is.</p>

You only need to do one trial for each measurement. Neatly tabulate your data.</p></li>
