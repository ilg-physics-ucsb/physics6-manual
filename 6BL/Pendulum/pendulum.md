## PART 1: WHAT&rsquo;S IMPORTANT?

The objective of this lab is to determine the physical quantities that influence the period of a pendulum. The period is how long it takes for the pendulum to make one complete cycle of motion. The relevant features are the mass of the bob, the length of the pendulum, and the initial angular displacement. We will test each of these features separately by varying one of them while keeping the other two constant.

**You will be expected to turn in all plots and tables that you are asked to make in the exercises, as well as all answers to questions.**

<!-- Mass Constant -->

:::Exercise

Let&rsquo;s start by varying the mass and keeping the length and initial angle constant.

For our pendulum setup we have five different bobs that we can put at the end of our pendulum. Below is a video showing the mass of each bob being measured. Watch this video to determine the mass of each of the five bobs. Throughout this lab, we will use the same numbering scheme for each bob that we use in this video, so when we say, for example, &ldquo;Mass 4&rdquo; in a later video, we are talking about the same mass presented here.

<!-- Measuring Mass -->

:::

1. Make a two-column table with the first column being the name (*e.g.* &ldquo;Mass 1&rdquo;) and the second column being the measured mass. Make the video pause, and use the triple beam balance to make your best measurement of the mass. You will be adding columns to this table shortly.

In the next video you will be shown 5 different pendulums. The only thing that is different among the five pendulums is the mass that is used. The initial angle for each setup is $20^{\circ}$, and the length is 80 cm.

<!-- 5 Masses All 20 Degrees-->

:::

2. For each mass, using the stopwatch in the video, a stopwatch app, or the video timestamp, record the time it takes for the pendulum to make 5 complete periods. A complete period is the time it takes for the pendulum to swing back and forth once. (Start the stopwatch when the pendulum is at the beginning of a period, then, when it has reached the end of the fifth period from the start, stop the stopwatch.) Take this time and divide it by five to obtain an average time for one period. Record these data in a new column in your table.

:::Question
Does the period depend on mass? Justify your answer.
:::

:::

:::Exercise
<!-- Angle Vary -->
In this exercise we will now vary the initial angle while keeping the length and mass constant.

Conventional analysis of the pendulum is done for small angles, where the restoring force experienced by the mass is approximately linear with the displacement angle. Linear restoring force is one of the criteria for simple harmonic motion. When the displacement angles become large, the restoring force is no longer linear. The motion is still periodic, but it is not sinusoidal, and the mathematical analysis becomes far more involved.

You will be working with only a single mass for this part of the experiment, and only pendulum length. Below is a video of a pendulum with mass 3. The video shows the pendulum starting at the different initial angles of $5^{\circ}$, $10^{\circ}$, and $15^{\circ}$. (The mass and the length stay constant.) You will collect your data from this video.

1. Make a new data table where you will record the period for each initial angle.

2. Use the same method as in Exercise 1 to measure the period.

:::Exercise
<!-- Varying Length -->
In this exercise we will vary length while keeping mass and initial angle constant.

In the following video you will see 3 pendulums all having the same mass (mass 3) and initial angle of $10^{\circ}$. The only thing that varies among runs is the length. After each run, there will be a close-up of the mass with a meterstick in the background. You can use this to make your own length measurement.

1. Build a new data table that will contain the data for the lengths and the periods for each run.

2. Use the same method as in Exercises 1 and 2 to measure the period. Make the video pause after each run, record the period, then measure and record the length.

## PART 2: DETERMINING THE MATHEMATICAL DEPENDENCE

### Collecting Data is Half the Job
As a professional scientist, the point of data collection is to *differentiate* between models: numbers, equations and miscellaneous data are ultimately **useless** unless they can be combined into a complete scientific theory capable of making accurate, precise predictions. This is true whether you work with material, particle or astro- physics or if you study epidemiology, data science or even medicine. 

The most common scenerio you face as a scientist is arguing for or against the validity of one or more theoretical models. In the next excercise you will carefully take data, and use your sharp analytical skills to *differentiate* between two proposed theories made by your friends, addessing if either are correct by a well thought-out argument.

### The Scenerio

Years from now, as a NASA astronaut-engineer, you are introducing your newfound alien friends, Alpa and Beetuh, to the laws of Newtonian physics. Alpa and Beetuh have become particularly obsessed with the memorizing motion of pendulums but, lacking technology (and dexterity), they aren't able to take data or analyze it themselves. 
####
From watching it for hours with their three eyes, Alpa is *sure* that the period of a pendulum with a small anglular displacement is proportional to the length of the string, $T \propto L^{2/3}$. Beetah, on the other hand thinks that it *must* be propotional to the squareroot $T \propto\sqrt L$. 
####
You (of course) know the correct answer, but fondly reflecting on your education at UCSB, you decide to help them conduct an experiment and analyze data to settle the argument.
####

You designed an experiment to demonstrate the relationship between length and period, which is identical to that described in the following excercise.

::: Exercise

Below is a video of several pendulums with mass 4. The initial angles are all $10^{\circ}$. We will vary the length from about 76 cm to 22 cm. You will be making period measurements for each length. This time you can use the lengths given.

1. Make a data table that has the length and period for each run.

2. Watch the video and record your data.

<!-- Varying Lengths -->

3. Make a plot of period vs. length.

:::Question
a) Describe the relationship between length and period.

b) What type of trend line both fits the data and makes sense?

<!-- There is now a whole lab that takes the place of this graphing tutorial.  It is left here for reference.

## PART 3: LOG-LOG GRAPHING TUTORIAL

:::Exercise

1. Consider the simple linear relationship $y = 3x$. Make a table of *x* and *y* values for values of $x = 1,2,3,4,5$. Leave room in the table for more calculations.

2. Next to this, make another table, this time recording the $\rm log_{10}\it (x)$, and the $\rm log_{10}\it(y)$. Plot the value of $\rm log_{10}\it(x)$ on the independent axis. Plot the value of $\rm log_{10}\it(y)$ on the dependent axis.

:::Question
a. What is the slope of this line, and why is it significant?

b. What is the *y*-intercept? What is the inverse $log(10^{x})$ of this value, and why is it significant?
:::

:::

:::Exercise

1. Consider the non-linear relationship $y = 4x^{3}$. Again make a table of *x* and *y* values for values of $x = 1,2,3,4,5$. Add two columns to the table, this time recording $\rm log_{10}\it(x)$, and $\rm log_{10}\it(y)$. Plot the value of $\rm log_{10}\it(x)$ on the independent axis. Plot the value of $\rm log_{10}\it(y)$ on the dependent axis.

::: Question
a. What is the slope of this line and what does it represent?

b. What is the *y*-intercept? What is the antilog of this value and why is it important?
:::

2. Taking the logarithm of both sides changes $$y = \rm 4\it x^{\rm 3}$$ into $$\rm log_{10}\it(y) = \rm log_{10}(4\it x^{\rm 3})$$

:::Question
a. Use the logarithm property
$\rm log_{10}\it(ab) = \rm log_{10}\it(a) + \rm log_{10}\it(b)$ to reduce the right hand side of this relationship. Explain how this relates to the y-intercept on your graph.
:::


3. Now use the logarithm property $\rm log_{10}(\it a^{b}) = b\rm log_{10}\it(a)$ to further reduce the right hand side.


:::Question
a. Show this math. Explain how this relates to the slope of your graph. Hint: Your graph has an independent variable of $\rm log_{10}\it(x)$, not $x$.

b. Consider the relationship $y = x^{1/3}$. If you made a log-log plot of this, what would the slope be?

### Analyzing the Data
Recalling your data analysis lesson, you recall learning about &ldquo;linearizing&rdquo; data, that is, making nonlinear data fit a straight line. One method you used was changing the independent variable of your data, which works great when you have an idea about what the equation *should* look like. The other method you used was to take the logarithm of both *x* and *y* values, to plot them, and from that plot find the power of *x* (and/or *y*) and the proportionality constant in the original equation. 

In the following excercise, you are asked to use one of these techniques to accept or reject the hypotheses of Alpa and Beetuh.

::: Exercise
** Option 1: Independent Variable **
1. Using the data from Part 2, make a table of $L^{2/3},L^{1/2}$ and $T$. Make two plots Plot $\rm log_{10}(Length)$ on the independent axis, and $T$ on the dependent axis.

::: Question
a) What are the values of the slopes of these lines? What are their significance?

b) What are the *y*-intercepts of these lines? What are their significance?

c) Based on the appearance of these graphs, which do you think most accurately captures the data? Give a detailed explanation of your reasoning
:::

The relationship between the period and length can be expressed:

$$
\rm Period = 2\pi \left (\frac{Length}{\it a} \right )^{\it b}
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are unknown values.

1.  Using the slope and *y*-intercept of the best graph, determine the quantities $a$ and $b$.

::: Question
a. What is your measured value of $b$? What do you think $b$ should be, and what does it tell you about the relationship between period and length?

b. What is the value of $a$ and what does it suggest? **Hint: Think of quantities that are physically relevant to the experiment.**

c. Use dimensional analysis to show that this interpretation of $a$ makes sense.

d. With the derived values for $a$ and $b$, write the explicit mathematical relationship between Period and Length.

e. Based on this analysis, give an explanation to Alpa and Beetuh summarizing which hypothesis is correct and how they can come to this conclusion by inspecting the data on their own.
:::

:::

::: Exercise
** Option 2: Log-Log ***
1. Using the data from Part 2, make a table of $\rm log_{10}(Length)$ and $\rm log_{10}(Period)$. Plot $\rm log_{10}(Length)$ on the independent axis, and $\rm log_{10}(Period)$ on the dependent axis. **Hint: Convert length measurements to meters.**

::: Question
a) What is the value of the slope of this line? What is its significance?

b) What is the *y*-intercept of this line?
:::

The relationship between the period and length can be expressed:

$$
\rm Period = 2\pi \left (\frac{Length}{\it a} \right )^{\it b}
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are unknown values.

2. Start with the equation given above. Take the logarithm of both sides, and reduce this equation by using the logarithmic properties listed above. SHOW THIS WORK.

In your final reduction, you should recognize that some values are constant, while one term is dependent upon Length (specifically the $\rm log_{10}(Length)$).

3.  Using the slope and *y*-intercept of your log-log graph, determine the quantities $a$ and $b$.

::: Question
a. What is your measured value of $b$? What do you think $b$ should be, and what does it tell you about the relationship between period and length?

b. What is the value of $a$ and what does it suggest? **Hint: Think of quantities that are physically relevant to the experiment.**

c. Use dimensional analysis to show that this interpretation of $a$ makes sense.

d. With the derived values for $a$ and $b$, write the explicit mathematical relationship between Period and Length.

e. Based on this information, give an explanation to Alpa and Beetuh summarizing which hypothesis is correct and how they can come to this conclusion.
