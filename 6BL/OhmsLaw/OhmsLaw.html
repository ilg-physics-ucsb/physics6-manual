<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>During the nineteenth century so many advances were made in understanding the electrical nature of matter that it has been called the “age of electricity.” One such advance was made by an investigator named Georg Simon Ohm. Ohm was interested in examining the relationship between an applied voltage and the resulting current in a conducting material.</p>
<p>He found that for a given conductor the current in the wire was directly proportional to the voltage across it. When current (dependent axis) is plotted against the voltage (independent axis) in a given conductor, the data forms a straight line. The reciprocal of the slope is the resistance of the conductor.</p>
<p>This result was published in 1826. In recognition of Ohm’s work, this empirical relationship bears his name and is symbolized by <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-understanding-circuits-and-resistance">PART 1: Understanding Circuits and Resistance</h2>
<h3 id="circuits">Circuits</h3>
<p>A circuit is a closed loop of wires and components that allows electrons to flow through it. The flow of electrons is referred to as <strong>current</strong>, and it varies at different parts of a circuit. The flow of electrons is caused by differences in electrical potential, the amount of which is referred to as <strong>voltage</strong>. Differences in voltage are provided by power sources, often times, a battery. As the power source causes a current to flow, electrical potential energy is converted into electrical kinetic energy as current. This leads to the draining of your power source over time. For any particular voltage, the current that flows will be determined by the <strong>resistance</strong> of the medium through which it is flowing. The larger the resistance, the more difficult it is for electrons to flow, and thus the lower the current. Refine this explanation, make some good analogy to a physical system. AVOCADO <!-- Circuits are analogous to other systems that flow such as piped water. Water held at a height has a potential and when drained can flow water out.  --></p>
<p>A simple circuit can be analogized by a system of water flowing through pipes. Imagine a loop of pipes filled with water. A pump which takes water to a higher height is similar to a power source that is creating a potential energy. The ware then flows down from that source analogous to current until it reaches the lower potential then gets pumped back up by means of the power source. As the water is flowing the resistance in the pipes determines the rate of flow. A pipe with more obstructions will reduce the flow more than a pipe with no obstructions. AVOCADO, not well worded analogy I feel.</p>
<h3 id="resistance">Resistance</h3>
<p>Resistance is the measure of opposition to some flow, in electrical circuits this flow is the flow of electrons, otherwise known as current. As such, resistance reduces the current that can flow due to a voltage source. The unit of resistance is the Ohm, it is characterized by the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
<p>Resistance is primarily affected by two things. First is a material’s intrinsic property known as resistivity. Second is the geometry of the material, particularly the cross-sectional area and the length of the material. Resistivity varies from material to material and is similar to density. The greater the resistivity of a material, the greater the resistance of that object for a given geometry. The geometry’s affect on the resistance is more complex than just volume. Remember that current flows through something, therefore discussing volume generally is not important. Looking at the length the current must travel and the area through which is travels is what gives us the important information we are looking for. The longer a resistive object is, the greater its resistance is, however, the larger the cross-sectional area of an object, the smaller the resistance is. This is characterized by the equation below.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{resistance}\ (\Omega) = \frac{ρ_{resistivity}\ (\Omega\ cm) \cdot L(cm)}{A(cm^2)}\]</span></p>
<p>To return to our piping analogy, resistivity is like obstructions in a pipe such as rocks and other blockages. The more obstructions, the harder it is for the water to flow. Early resistors were made by coiling lengths of resistive wire. Resistors today are often made by taking carbon composite and binding it using some binding material with such a density as to get the desired resistance. These obstructions can be seen as the non-conductive gaps in the otherwise conductive material AVOCADO (Not a good sentence). As the length of the pipe increases, the amount of obstructions also increases overall, making it harder yet for the water to flow. As the cross-sectional area increases, there becomes far more space around the obstructions for the water to flow around, thus the obstructions become a much smaller percentage of the total region in which the water can flow and the flow increases. Imagine trying to pump water through a massive pipe a meter in diameter, water would flow quite easily. Now try pumping the same amount of water in a pipe a millimeter in diameter, it would be far more difficult to push the same amount of water through this pipe.</p>
<p>Check out Simulation 1 to see how the values of <span class="math inline">\(ρ,\ L\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> affect <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Please note the visual representation of the resistor and how it changes with these values.</p>

</figure>
<p>The resistivity of a material can be dependent on temperature. This, however, is generally taken into account by manufacturers to minimize this effect to create constant resistors. In devices where temperature dependent resistance is useful, manufacturers take make it work yo such that resistors are designed to not change resistance when within their operating temperatures. Resistors that are designed to change with temperature are called thermistors, we will not be dealing with those in this lab.</p>
<div class="ENumber">
<p>Exercise 1</p>
<div class="Exercise">
<p>Modern resistors are made using a carbon composite to create resistors of a consistent size. Earlier resistors however were made by coiling resistive wire, such as Nichrome, around an insulating core until the desired resistance was achieved.</p>
<p>A typical modern resistor made of composite may be about <span class="math inline">\(8.5\ mm\)</span> long and <span class="math inline">\(3.2\ mm\)</span> in diameter. Nichrome has a resistivity, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, of approximately <span class="math inline">\(10^{-6}\ \Omega\ cm\)</span>.</p>

<p>You may have noticed the value of part d above is quite large. This would result in a very inconvenient resistor, as it would be huge compared to modern electronics. This large length is due to the large cross-sectional area of the resistor.

<h3 id="ohms-law">Ohm’s Law</h3>
<p>Ohm’s law is most simply expressed as the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = I \cdot R\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(V\)</span></strong> represents the voltage across the resistor measured in volts,</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(I\)</span></strong> the current in the resistor measured in amperes, and</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></strong> the resistance of the resistor measured in units called “ohms” symbolized the upper-case Greek omega <span class="math inline">\((\Omega)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In words, Ohm’s law states that “the voltage V across the ends of a resistor R and the current I flowing through this resistor are proportional.” If the potential difference across a resistor is set at 1 volt, and if a current of 1 amp is measured in the resistor, then its resistance is determined to be 1 ohm.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1A = 1000mA\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1k \Omega = 1000\Omega\]</span></p>
<p>Algebraic rearrangement gives the current in terms of the voltage and resistance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = V/R\]</span></p>
<p>This is exactly what you just saw in the previous experiment. From this equation, it should be clear why the reciprocal of the slope is the resistance. Further algebraical rearrangement yields the proportionality constant R, which is the electrical resistance of the device.</p>

<!-- ### Circuit Construction and Simulation

Here we will cover the basics of circuit components and how to use them. This simulation will be used later in the lab and will prove to be a very helpful tool for verifying your results from your video exercises. The systems set up in the simulation are directly analogous to those you would be setting up in real life. 



As described above, a simple circuit has three different descriptive values: voltage, resistance, and current.  

Note, ammeters must be placed in circuit such that the current flows through it. Voltmeters measure voltage across circuit elements meaning they stay out of the circuit and probe at various points.



Basically part 5 of the outline.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Current must flow through an ammeter. It must be part of the circuit loop.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Voltage is measured across circuit elements. Voltmeters are not part of the circuit loop, but must instead be placed with one terminal on each side of the element you wish to measure.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The gray box is a power supply protection device. If the red light is on, everything is ok. If it is off, it has broken the circuit for safety. Too much current was being drawn. AVOCADO (To be removed I assume, unless we want a note about it so the students know it should be there)</p>

<!-- ### Series and Parallel Introductions -->
<p>Now that you have seen simple circuits, we can explore more complex ones. There are two ways in which components may be connected together, in series and in parallel. AVOCADO Double Check wording</p>
<h4 id="series-circuits">Series Circuits</h4>
<p>In order for current to move through a circuit, there must be a complete path leading away from and back to the source voltage. In a simple series circuit there is only one such path. It is important to note that the same amount of current flows through all points of a series circuit. If this were not the case, there would be points where current was either created or destroyed. <em>The current through each element is the same</em>, however the total circuit voltage is divided among the individual resistors. For this reason, the circuit in the previous experiment is commonly known as a voltage divider. Individual series resistors add to form a total resistance. Individual voltages in series circuits add to form the total circuit voltage. The entire source voltage will be dropped across the combination of two resistors. The voltage across each individual resistor is proportional to its individual resistance.</p>
<!-- The circuit has a simple and useful ratio equivalence:

$$\frac{Individual\ Resistance\ Value}{Total\ Resistance\ Value} = \frac{Individual\ Voltage\ Dropped}{Total\ Voltage\ Dropped}$$

Algebraic manipulation shows us:

$$Individual\ Voltage\ Dropped = Source\ Voltage \cdot \frac{Individual\ Resistance}{Total\ Resistance}$$

Thus the name voltage divider refers to the fact that the voltage will divide according to the ratio of the two resistances. -->
<!-- ::: Question
a) A series circuit has a source voltage of 20V and two resistances of 1.7K and 2.6K, respectively. What is the total circuit current? What are the voltages across each resistor? Show that Ohm’s Law holds for each element individually.
::: -->
<h4 id="parallel-circuits">Parallel Circuits</h4>
<p>You’ve now been familiarized with the relationship between current, voltage and resistance for a single resistor. In circuits, any point connected by a wire is considered to be the same point. Thus when we connect two or three resistors in parallel they all have the same voltage across them. In this scenario, Ohm’s law applies to each resistor individually. If the resistance values are different, the current through that branch will also be different. In a parallel arrangement the current can divide at the top junction and recombine at the bottom junction. Because there are multiple paths on which current can flow, more current can flow for a given voltage value. Thus, the equivalent resistance will be less than any one of the individual paths.</p>
<!-- The equation to determine the equivalent resistance of a network of parallel resistors is:

$$1/R_{equivalent} = 1/R_{1} + 1/R_{2} + 1/R_{3}$$

in the above experiment, all of the resistances were equal.

::: Question
a) What is the equivalent resistance of a parallel network of 2.2kΩ, 3.1kΩ and 6.7kΩ?
b) A 2.2kΩ resistor is placed in series with 1.7kΩ and 2.6kΩ resistors in parallel. The entire circuit is driven by 18V. What is the voltage across each element? What is the current through each element?

<p><span class="math display">\[1/R_{equivalent} = 1/R_{1} + 1/R_{2} + 1/R_{3}\]</span></p>
<p>in the above experiment, all of the resistances were equal.</p>

<p>Question 9</p>
<div class="Question">
<ol type="a">
<li>What is the equivalent resistance of a parallel network of 2.2kΩ, 3.1kΩ and 6.7kΩ?</li>
<li>A 2.2kΩ resistor is placed in series with 1.7kΩ and 2.6kΩ resistors in parallel. The entire circuit is driven by 18V. What is the voltage across each element? What is the current through each element?</li>

<p>Now that you have seen both series and parallel circuits, we will be using a simulation to look at advanced circuits.</p>
<h3 id="building-circuits-in-simulation">Building Circuits in Simulation</h3>
<p>Here we will cover the basics of circuit building using Simulation GUAC. You will use this simulator to build circuits for analysis of equivalence resistance? The components and set up of the simulation are directly analogous to what would be made in the lab.</p>
<p>Video GUAC is a brief overview of the simulation and how it works.</p>
