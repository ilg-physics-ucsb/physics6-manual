<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>During the nineteenth century so many advances were made in understanding the electrical nature of matter that it has been called the “age of electricity.” One such advance was made by an investigator named Georg Simon Ohm. Ohm was interested in examining the relationship between an applied voltage and the resulting current in a conducting material.</p>
<p>He found that for a given conductor the current in the wire was directly proportional to the voltage across it. When current (dependent axis) is plotted against the voltage (independent axis) in a given conductor, the data forms a straight line. The reciprocal of the slope is the resistance of the conductor.</p>
<p>This result was published in 1826. In recognition of Ohm’s work, this empirical relationship bears his name.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-understanding-circuits-and-resistance">PART 1: Understanding Circuits and Resistance</h2>
<h3 id="circuits">Circuits</h3>
<p>A circuit is a closed loop of wires and components that allows electrons to travel in it. The travel of electrons is referred to as the <strong>current</strong>, and it varies at different parts of a circuit. The flow of electrons is caused by differences in electrical potential, the amount of which is referred to as <strong>voltage</strong>. Differences in voltage are provided by power sources, often times, a battery. As the power source causes a current to flow, electrical potential energy is converted into electrical kinetic energy as current. This leads to the draining of your power source over time. what reduces the current flow from a particular voltage is <strong>resistance</strong>.Refine this explanation, make some good analogy to a physical system. AVOCADO <!-- Circuits are analogous to other systems that flow such as piped water. Water held at a height has a potential and when drained can flow water out.  --></p>
<h3 id="resistance">Resistance</h3>
<p>Resistance is the measure of opposition to some flow, in electrical circuits this flow is the flow of electrons, otherwise known as current. As such, resistance reduces the current that can flow due to a voltage source.</p>
<p>Resistance is primarily affected by two things. First is a material’s intrinsic property known as resistivity. Second is the geometry of the material, particularly the cross-sectional area and the length of the material. Resistivity varies from material to material and is similar to density. The greater the resistivity of a material, the greater the resistance of that object for a given geometry. The geometry’s affect on the resistance is more complex than just volume. Remember that current flows through something, therefore discussing volume generally is not important. Looking at the length the current must travel and the area through which is travels is what gives us the important information we are looking for. The longer a resistive object is, the greater its resistance is, however, the larger the cross-sectional area of that object, the smaller the resistance is. This is all characterized in the equation below.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{resistance}\ (\Omega) = \frac{ρ_{resistivity}\ (\Omega\ cm) \cdot L(cm)}{A(cm^2)}\]</span></p>
<p>This is analogous to a pipe with flowing water. Resistivity is like obstructions in the pipe such as rocks and other blockages, the more obstructions, the harder it is for the water to flow. Resistors are often made by taking carbon composite and binding it using some binding material, these obstructions can be seen as the non-conductive gaps in the otherwise conductive material AVOCADO (Not a good sentence). As the length of the pipe increases, the amount of obstructions also increases overall, making it harder yet for the water to flow. As the area increases, the obstructions become a much smaller percentage of the total region in which the water can flow, thus the flow increases. Imagine trying to pump water through a massive pipe a meter in diameter, water would flow quite easily. Not try pumping the same amount of water in a pipe a millimeter in diameter, it would be far more difficult for the water to flow through this pipe.</p>
<p>Check out Simulation 1 to see how the values of <span class="math inline">\(ρ,\ L\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> affect <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Please note the visual representation of the resistor and how it changes with these values.</p>

</figure>
<p>One other aspect that affects resistance is temperature. This, however, is generally taken into account by manufacturers such that resistors are designed to not change resistance within their operating temperatures. Resistors that are designed to change with temperature are called thermistors, we will not be dealing with those in this lab.</p>

<h3 id="theory---ohms-law">Theory - Ohm’s Law</h3>
<p>Ohm’s law is most simply expressed as the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = I \cdot R\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(V\)</span></strong> represents the voltage across the resistor measured in volts,</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(I\)</span></strong> the current in the resistor measured in amperes, and</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></strong> the resistance of the resistor measured in units called “ohms” symbolized the upper-case Greek omega <span class="math inline">\((\Omega)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In words, Ohm’s law states that “the voltage V across the ends of a resistor R and the current I flowing through this resistor are proportional.” If the potential difference across a resistor is set at 1 volt, and if a current of 1 amp is measured in the resistor, then its resistance is determined to be 1 ohm.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1A = 1000mA\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1k \Omega = 1000\Omega\]</span></p>
<p>Algebraic rearrangement gives the current in terms of the voltage and resistance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = V/R\]</span></p>
<p>This is exactly what you just saw in the previous experiment. From this equation, it should be clear why the reciprocal of the slope is the resistance. Further algebraical rearrangement yields the proportionality constant R, which is the electrical resistance of the device.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R = V/I\]</span></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The circuit is wired as a loop. Starting from the negative terminal of the power supply, it continues to the next circuit element, then to the next, and so on and so forth until it arrives back at the positive terminal of the power supply.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Current must flow through an ammeter. It must be part of the circuit loop.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Voltage is measured across circuit elements. Voltmeters are not part of the circuit loop, but must instead be placed with one terminal on each side of the element you wish to measure.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The gray box is a power supply protection device. If the red light is on, everything is ok. If it is off, it has broken the circuit for safety. Too much current was being drawn.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This will reduce the voltage somewhat, always trust the yellow meters, not the read out on the blue power supply. Otherwise, you may treat the output of the gray box as though it was the output of the power supply.</p>

<h3 id="theory---series-circuits">Theory - Series Circuits</h3>
<p>In order for current to move through a circuit, there must be a complete path leading away from and back to the source voltage. In a simple series circuit there is only one such path. It is important to note that the same amount of current flows through all points of a series circuit. If this were not the case, there would be points where current was either created or destroyed. Top minds in physics maintain that this does not happen. <em>The current through each element is the same</em>, however the total circuit voltage is divided among the individual resistors. For this reason, the circuit in the previous experiment is commonly known as a voltage divider. Individual series resistors add to form a total resistance. Individual voltages in series circuits add to form the total circuit voltage. The entire source voltage will be dropped across the combination of two resistors. The voltage across each individual resistor is proportional to its individual resistance. The circuit has a simple and useful ratio equivalence:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{Individual\ Resistance\ Value}{Total\ Resistance\ Value} = \frac{Individual\ Voltage\ Dropped}{Total\ Voltage\ Dropped}\]</span></p>
<p>Algebraic manipulation shows us:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Individual\ Voltage\ Dropped = Source\ Voltage \cdot \frac{Individual\ Resistance}{Total\ Resistance}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus the name voltage divider refers to the fact that the voltage will divide according to the ratio of the two resistances.</p>

<h3 id="theory---parallel-circuits">Theory - Parallel Circuits</h3>
<p>You’ve now been familiarized with the relationship between current, voltage and resistance for a single resistor. In circuits, any point connected by a wire is considered to be the same point. Thus when we connect two or three resistors in parallel they all have the same voltage across them. In this scenario, Ohm’s law applies to each resistor individually. If the resistance values are different, the current through that branch will also be different. In a parallel arrangement the current can divide at the top junction and recombine at the bottom junction. Because there are multiple paths on which current can flow, more current can flow for a given voltage value. Thus, the equivalent resistance will be less than any one of the individual paths. The equation to determine the equivalent resistance of a network of parallel resistors is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1/R_{equivalent} = 1/R_{1} + 1/R_{2} + 1/R_{3}\]</span></p>
