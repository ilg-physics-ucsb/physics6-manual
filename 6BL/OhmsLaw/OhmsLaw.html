<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<!-- During the nineteenth century so many advances were made in understanding the electrical nature of matter that it has been called the “age of electricity.” One such advance was made by an investigator named Georg Simon Ohm. Ohm was interested in examining the relationship between an applied voltage and the resulting current in a conducting material.  -->
<p>During the dawn of the age of electricity, an investigator named Georg Simon Ohm examined the relationship between an applied voltage and the resulting current in a conducting material.</p>
<p>He found that for a given conductor the current in the wire was directly proportional to the voltage across it. When current (dependent axis) is plotted against the voltage (independent axis) across a given conductor, the data form a straight line. The reciprocal of the slope is the resistance of the conductor.</p>
<p>This result was published in 1826. In recognition of Ohm’s work, this empirical relationship bears his name (Ohm’s Law), as does the unit of resistance, the ohm, which is also symbolized by <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="circuits-and-resistance">Circuits and Resistance</h3>
<!-- A circuit is a closed loop of wires and components that allows electrons to flow through it. The flow of electrons is referred to as **current**, and it varies at different parts of a circuit. The flow of electrons is caused by differences in electrical potential, the amount of which is referred to as **voltage**. Differences in voltage are provided by power sources, often times, a battery. As the power source causes a current to flow, electrical potential energy is converted into electrical kinetic energy as current. This leads to the draining of your power source over time. For any particular voltage, the current that flows will be determined by the **resistance** of the medium through which it is flowing. The larger the resistance, the more difficult it is for electrons to flow, and thus the lower the current. AVOCADO (Do final wording check of this paragraph) <!-- Circuits are analogous to other systems that flow such as piped water. Water held at a height has a potential and when drained can flow water out.  -->
<!-- A simple circuit can be analogized by a system of water flowing through pipes. Imagine a loop of pipes filled with water. A pump which takes water to a higher height is similar to a power source that is creating a potential energy difference. The water then flows down from that source analogous to current until it reaches the lower potential then gets pumped back up by means of the power source. As the water is flowing the resistance in the pipes determines the rate of flow. The more obstructions a pipe has, the slower the water will flow. The initial height or potential of the water also affects the rate of flow. The higher the potential, the greater the flow. AVOCADO (Do final wording check for this paragraph) -->
<!-- Resistance is the measure of opposition to some flow, in electrical circuits this flow is the flow of electrons, otherwise known as current. As such, resistance reduces the current that can flow due to a voltage source. The unit of resistance is the Ohm, it is characterized by the symbol $\Omega$. A component in a circuit designed to have a set resistance is called a **resistor**. In our pipe analogy a resistor would be an obstruction or a kink in the piping. -->
<!-- This video describes our pipe analogy such that AVOCADO (Reword and pick video, and make the link external) -->
<p>A circuit is a closed loop of wires and components that allows electrons to flow through it. The flow of electrons is referred to as <strong>current</strong>, and it varies at different parts of a circuit (assuming that the circuit is more than just a single loop). The unit of current is the ampere (after André Marie Ampere), sometimes shortened to “amp,” abbreviated A. The flow of electrons is caused by differences in electrical potential between different parts of the circuit. The unit of electrical potential is the volt (after Alessandro Volta), abbreviated V, and potential difference is often referred to as <strong>voltage</strong>. Generators, power supplies and batteries provide such potential differences. When such a power source is connected to a circuit, it converts electrical potential energy into electrical kinetic energy, and thus causes current to flow in the circuit. This leads to the draining of the power source over time. (An electrical power supply plugged into the wall will not drain, but it will consume fuel burned by the generator that provides its current.) If we place a particular voltage across a piece of conductive material, the current that flows is determined by the <strong>resistance</strong> of that material. The larger the resistance, the more difficult it is for electrons to flow, and thus the lower the current. As noted above, the unit of resistance is the ohm, which is also symbolized as <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>. A component in a circuit designed to have a particular resistance is called a <strong>resistor</strong>. <!-- Circuits are analogous to other systems that flow such as piped water. Water held at a height has a potential and when drained can flow water out.  --></p>
<p>A useful analogy for understanding current flow in circuits is to compare it to the flow of water in a sysetem of pipes. Consider a loop of pipes filled with water, with a pump circulating the water through the loop. The pump is analogous to a battery or power supply, the difference in pressure between the outlet and the return like the potential difference between the terminals of a battery. The pipe is like the wire, with water taking the place of the electric current. The water flows from the high-pressure outlet of the pump (high electrical potential), through the pipe to the low-pressure inlet of the pump (low electrical potential). The characteristics of the pipe – its length, cross-sectional area, and the presence and nature of any obstructions – constitute its resistance. Together with the pressure difference between the two ends of the pump, this determines the rate of water flow in the loop. The greater the pressure difference between the outlet and inlet of the pump, the greater the flow. The greater the resistance of the pipes, the lesser the flow.</p>

<h3 id="ohms-law">Ohm’s Law</h3>
<p>Ohm’s law is most simply expressed as the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = I \cdot R\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(V\)</span></strong> represents the voltage across the resistor, measured in volts,</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(I\)</span></strong> the current in the resistor, measured in amperes, and</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></strong> the resistance of the resistor measured, as noted above, in units called “ohms,” and symbolized by the upper-case Greek omega <span class="math inline">\((\Omega)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In words, Ohm’s law states that “the voltage V across the ends of a resistor R, and the current I flowing through this resistor, are proportional.” If the potential difference across a resistor is set at 1 volt, and if a current of 1 amp is measured in the resistor, then its resistance is determined to be 1 ohm.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1A = 1000mA\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1k \Omega = 1000\Omega\]</span></p>
<p>Algebraic rearrangement gives the current in terms of the voltage and resistance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = V/R\]</span></p>
<p>This is what is stated in the introduction, and what you just saw in the simulations above. From this equation, it should be clear why the reciprocal of the slope of a plot of current vs. voltage is the resistance. Further algebraic rearrangement yields R directly (instead of its reciprocal):</p>

<p>In Simulation 1 you will see a simple but effective demonstration of Ohm’s Law. Use this simulation to gain understanding of Ohm’s Law and how changing either the resistance of the resistor or the voltage across it changes the current. Notice that the size of each symbol changes to illustrate the change in magnitude of that value. In addition, the orange arrows on the the corners of the circuit change in size according to the magnitude of the current.</p>

<!-- ### Circuit Construction and Simulation

Here we will cover the basics of circuit components and how to use them. This simulation will be used later in the lab and will prove to be a very helpful tool for verifying your results from your video exercises. The systems set up in the simulation are directly analogous to those you would be setting up in real life. 



As described above, a simple circuit has three different descriptive values: voltage, resistance, and current.  

Note, ammeters must be placed in circuit such that the current flows through it. Voltmeters measure voltage across circuit elements meaning they stay out of the circuit and probe at various points.



Basically part 5 of the outline.

<!-- ### Series and Parallel Introductions -->
<p>Now that you have seen simple circuits, we can explore more complex ones. There are two ways in which components may be connected together, in series and in parallel. <!-- #### Series Circuits

In order for current to move through a circuit, there must be a complete path leading away from and back to the source voltage. In a simple series circuit there is only one such path. It is important to note that the same amount of current flows through all points of a series circuit. If this were not the case, there would be points where current was either created or destroyed. *The current through each element is the same*, however the total circuit voltage is divided among the individual resistors. For this reason, the circuit in the previous experiment is commonly known as a voltage divider. Individual series resistors add to form a total resistance. Individual voltages in series circuits add to form the total circuit voltage. The entire source voltage will be dropped across the combination of two resistors. The voltage across each individual resistor is proportional to its individual resistance.  --></p>
<!-- The circuit has a simple and useful ratio equivalence:

$$\frac{Individual\ Resistance\ Value}{Total\ Resistance\ Value} = \frac{Individual\ Voltage\ Dropped}{Total\ Voltage\ Dropped}$$

Algebraic manipulation shows us:

$$Individual\ Voltage\ Dropped = Source\ Voltage \cdot \frac{Individual\ Resistance}{Total\ Resistance}$$

Thus the name voltage divider refers to the fact that the voltage will divide according to the ratio of the two resistances. -->
<!-- ::: Question
a) A series circuit has a source voltage of 20V and two resistances of 1.7K and 2.6K, respectively. What is the total circuit current? What are the voltages across each resistor? Show that Ohm’s Law holds for each element individually.

<!-- #### Parallel Circuits

You’ve now been familiarized with the relationship between current, voltage and resistance for a single resistor. In a parallel configuration we have two elements connected to each other at both ends. This is in contrast to series elements that have 

In circuits, any point connected by a wire is considered to be the same point. 

## Discuss this section AVOCADO I feel

Thus when we connect two or three resistors in parallel they all have the same voltage across them. In this scenario, Ohm’s law applies to each resistor individually. If the resistance values are different, the current through that branch will also be different.  -->
<!-- The equation to determine the equivalent resistance of a network of parallel resistors is:

$$1/R_{equivalent} = 1/R_{1} + 1/R_{2} + 1/R_{3}$$

in the above experiment, all of the resistances were equal.

a) What is the equivalent resistance of a parallel network of 2.2kΩ, 3.1kΩ and 6.7kΩ?
b) A 2.2kΩ resistor is placed in series with 1.7kΩ and 2.6kΩ resistors in parallel. The entire circuit is driven by 18V. What is the voltage across each element? What is the current through each element?

Because there are multiple paths on which current can flow, more current can flow for a given voltage value. Thus, the equivalent resistance will be less than any one of the individual paths.</p>
<p>The equation to determine the equivalent resistance of a network of parallel resistors is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{R_{Total}} =  \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_{3}}...\]</span></p>
<p>We see that when resistors are in parallel, their resistances add reciprocally. So the more resistors we add, the lower the total resistance becomes.</p>

<h3 id="resistivity-and-resistance">Resistivity and Resistance</h3>
<p>Resistance is primarily affected by two things. First is a material’s intrinsic property known as resistivity, which varies from material to material. The greater the resistivity of a material, the greater the resistance of an object made of that material. Second is the geometry of the material, particularly the cross-sectional area and the length of the material. Since current flows through the cross-sectional area of the material, increasing this area is like adding resistors in parallel; the greater the cross-sectional area, the lower the resistance. The length of the material is analogous to a set of resistors in series; the longer the piece of material, the greater its resistance. These relationships are expressed by the equation below.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{resistance}\ (\Omega) = \frac{ρ_{resistivity}\ (\Omega\ cm) \cdot L(cm)}{A(cm^2)}\]</span></p>
<p>To return to our piping analogy, resistivity is like obstructions in a pipe, such as rocks and other blockages. The more obstructions, the harder it is for the water to flow. The greater the cross-sectional area of the pipe, the more paths are available through the obstructions, and the lower the resistance to flow. The longer the pipe, the more obstructions the water encounters in going the length of the pipe, and the greater the resistance to flow.</p>
<p>Early resistors were made by coiling lengths of resistive wire around an insulating core. Resistors today are often made by taking carbon and mixing it with some kind of binding material, with such a density as to get the desired resistance.</p>
<p>Check out Simulation 3 to see how the values of <span class="math inline">\(ρ,\ L\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> affect <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Please note the visual representation of the resistor and how it changes with these values.</p>

<p>The resistivity of a material can be dependent on temperature. For fixed resistors, manufacturers choose their materials so as to minimize this effect. Materials whose resistance varies significantly with temperature, however, are useful for making devices called <em>thermistors</em>, which are often used as sensing elements in thermometers. We will not be working with such devices in this lab.</p>

<div class="Exercise">
<h2 id="notice-this-exercise-is-optional-and-does-not-provide-extra-credit.">Notice: This exercise is optional and does not provide extra credit.</h2>
<p>Modern resistors are made with a carbon composite, in such a way that resistors of a given type are consistent in size. Earlier resistors, however, were made by winding resistive wire, such as nichrome, around an insulating core until the desired resistance was achieved.</p>
<p>A typical modern resistor made of composite may be about <span class="math inline">\(8.5\ mm\)</span> long and <span class="math inline">\(3.2\ mm\)</span> in diameter. Nichrome has a resistivity, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, of approximately <span class="math inline">\(10^{-6}\ \Omega\ cm\)</span>.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>What is the resistivity, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, of a 750 <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> resistor that is in the standardized package mentioned above?</li>

</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>You may have noticed the value of part d above is quite large. This would result in a very inconvenient resistor, as it would be huge compared to modern electronics. This large length is due to the large cross-sectional area of the resistor. A modern resistor made of nichrome wire might use wire approximately <span class="math inline">\(0.1\ mm\)</span> in diameter wrapped around a core <span class="math inline">\(2.5\ mm\)</span> in diameter. One loop of this wire around the core is approximately <span class="math inline">\(7.85\ mm\)</span> long.</p>
