<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>During the nineteenth century so many advances were made in understanding the electrical nature of matter that it has been called the “age of electricity.” One such advance was made by an investigator named Georg Simon Ohm. Ohm was interested in examining the relationship between an applied voltage and the resulting current in a conducting material. He found that for a given conductor the current in the wire was directly proportional to the voltage across it. When current (dependent axis) is plotted against the voltage (independent axis) in a given conductor, the data forms a straight line. The reciprocal of the slope is the resistance of the conductor. This result was published in 1826. In recognition of Ohm’s work, this empirical relationship bears his name.</p>

If the red light is on, everything is ok. If it is off, it has broken the circuit for safety. Too much current was being drawn. <strong>Note:</strong> This will reduce the voltage somewhat, always trust the yellow meters, not the read out on the blue power supply.

<h3 id="theory---ohms-law">Theory - Ohm’s Law</h3>
<p>Ohm’s law is most simply expressed as the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = I \cdot R\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><strong>V</strong> represents the voltage across the resistor measured in volts, <strong>I</strong> the current in the resistor measured in amperes, and <strong>R</strong> the resistance of the resistor measured in units called “ohms” symbolized the upper-case Greek omega <span class="math inline">\((\Omega).\)</span></p>
<p>In words, Ohm’s law states that “the voltage V across the ends of a resistor R and the current I flowing through this resistor are proportional.” If the potential difference across a resistor is set at 1 volt, and if a current of 1 amp is measured in the resistor, then its resistance is determined to be 1 ohm.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1A = 1000mA\]</span> <span class="math display">\[1k \Omega = 1000\Omega\]</span></p>
<p>Algebraic rearrangement gives the current in terms of the voltage and resistance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = V/R\]</span></p>
<p>This is exactly what you just saw in the previous experiment. From this equation, it should be clear why the reciprocal of the slope is the resistance. Further algebraically rearrangement yields the proportionality constant R, which is the electrical resistance of the device.</p>

<h3 id="theory---series-circuits">Theory - Series Circuits</h3>
<p>In order for current to move through a circuit, there must be a complete path leading away from and back to the source voltage. In a simple series circuit there is only one such path. It is important to note that the same amount of current flows through all points of a series circuit. If this were not the case, there would be points where current was either created or destroyed. Top minds in physics maintain that this does not happen. <em>The current through each element is the same</em>, however the total circuit voltage is divided among the individual resistors. For this reason, the circuit in the previous experiment is commonly known as a voltage divider. Individual series resistors add to form a total resistance. Individual voltages in series circuits add to form the total circuit voltage. The entire source voltage will be dropped across the combination of two resistors. The voltage across each individual resistor is proportional to its individual resistance. The circuit has a simple and useful ratio equivalence:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{Individual Resistance Value}{Total Resistance Value} = \frac{Individual Voltage Dropped}{Total Voltage Dropped}\]</span></p>
<p>Algebraic manipulation shows us:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Individual Voltage Dropped = Source Voltage \cdot \frac{Individual Resistance}{Total Resistance}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus the name voltage divider refers to the fact that the voltage will divide according to the ratio of the two resistances.</p>

<h3 id="theory---parallel-circuits">Theory - Parallel Circuits</h3>
<p>You’ve now been familiarized with the relationship between current, voltage and resistance for a single resistor. In circuits, any point connected by a wire is considered to be the same point. Thus when we connect two or three resistors in parallel they all have the same voltage across them. In this scenario, Ohm’s law applies to each resistor individually. If the resistance values are different, the current through that branch will also be different. In a parallel arrangement the current can divide at the top junction and recombine at the bottom junction. Because there are multiple paths on which current can flow, more current can flow for a given voltage value. Thus, the equivalent resistance will be less than any one of the individual paths. The equation to determine the equivalent resistance of a network of parallel resistors is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1/R_{equivalent} = 1/R_{1} + 1/R_{2} + 1/R_{3}\]</span></p>
<p>in the above experiment, all of the resistances were equal.</p>
