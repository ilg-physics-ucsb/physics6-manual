## PART 1: PERMANENT MAGNETS AND ELECTROMAGNETS

### Gaining Intuition with Magnets

::: Exercise

In this exercise you will gain intuition with magnets and  magnetic field lines. Simulation 1 allows you to explore how magnets affect the region surrounding them.

1. Examine the &ldquo;Bar Magnet&rdquo; tab of Simulation 1. Notice the many compasses laid out in the background, and the single compass laid out in the foreground.

:::Figure:Simulation
!(https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/cheerpj/faraday/latest/faraday.html?simulation=magnets-and-electromagnets)
:::

::: Note
The north pole of each compass is painted red, similarly to that of the bar magnet. In this simulation there is no magnetic field due to the Earth. These compasses are affected only by the single bar magnet. This represents an idealized situation for study, where there is only one source of a magnetic field. In the real world, we would also see affects from the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field, and from any magnetized objects nearby. 
:::

<!-- For instance, if we performed this experiment on a table that had iron braces underneath the top, or other iron-containing hardware, and some of the braces or hardware had become magnetized, their magnetic fields could deflect the compass needles in unexpected ways. -->

2. Note the direction in which each compass points. Move the permanent magnet to the middle of the window. 
3. Slowly move the large compass in the foreground around to see how its needle orients itself with respect to the bar magnet.

:::Figure:Figure

:::
4. Grab a piece of paper and sketch a rectangle in the center to represent your bar magnet. Move the large compass around the magnet to ***roughly*** the location of each of the blue dots in Figure 1,  and draw an arrow on your paper in roughly the same location, pointing in the direction of the compass&rsquo;s north pole at that dot. Take about 10 data points.

:::Figure:Figure

Figure 2 shows the field lines, which are INSERT DEF AVOCADO. Notice that if you take a compass and place it on a field line it will point in the direction of the line.

### Air core electromagnet

A coil of wire with current flowing through it generates a magnetic field. We call this an electromagnet. If there is nothing but air inside of the coil it is an "air core" electromagnet. We can also put other materials such as iron inside of the coils to amplify the magnetic field, this would be called an "iron core" electromagnet.

::: Exercise
In Exercise 1 you gained intuition with a bar magnet. In this exercise you will be looking at an electromagnet made of a single coil of wire. Note that the core of this coil is air. You will be using Simulation 2 to explore what happens when you power an electromagnet. The circuit diagram for this experiment is shown in Figure 3 GUAC.

::: Figure:Figure
![Figure 1.2 – Wiring for basic electromagnet](imgs/Figure1.2_Wiring_basic_electromagnet.jpg)
:::

1. Examine the &ldquo;Electromagnet&rdquo; tab of Simulation 2. 
::: Note
You will have to change to the &ldquo;Electromagnet&rdquo; tab from the default &ldquo;Bar Magnet&rdquo; tab.
:::

:::Figure:Simulation
!(https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/cheerpj/faraday/latest/faraday.html?simulation=magnets-and-electromagnets)
:::

2. Notice the direction in which each compass points. Move the electromagnet coil to the middle of the window. 

::: Note
The electromagnet is the coil, not the battery.
:::

4. Slowly move the large compass in the foreground around to see how its needle orients itself with respect to the electromagnet.
5. Grab a piece of paper and sketch a coil in the center to represent your electromagnet. Move the large compass around the magnet to roughly the same 10 data points you took in Exercise 1. Draw arrows as you did before.

::: Question
Two magnetic fields are similar if a compass points in the same direction for all points in space. 

Based on your ten compass locations, is the magnetic field of a bar magnet similar to that of an electromagnet? Why or why not?
:::

5. Grab the slider on the battery and drag it to the center mark on the battery so that it says &ldquo;$0\ V$.&rdquo; This means that now there is no current passing through the coil. Notice that the compasses in the background are gone.
6. Slowly move the large compass in the foreground around the magnet to see how it behaves now.
7. Now drag the slider on the battery to the far left to switch the direction of the current flowing through the coil. The battery should now read -10V.

::: Question
b) What happens to the large compass when is it moved around while the battery is set to $0\ V$?

c) What happens to the small compasses when you reverse the current?
:::

:::


::: Note
**Magnetic fields are vectors, meaning that every point in space has both a magnitude and a direction associated with it. This direction is defined exactly as we’ve demonstrated above; it is the direction in which the north pole of a compass needle points under the influence of the field.**
:::

## PART 2: MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH

### Compass on the Axis of the Electromagnet

::: Exercise

In this exercise we will be exploring the strength of magnetic fields. We will use Video 2 to do this. 

We will be working with the system described in Figure 4 GUAC. This system uses a coil that has an air core, just as in Exercise 2. The large compass is placed on the axis of the coil, about $5\ cm$ away.

:::Figure:Figure
![Figure 2.1– Shows wiring, also shows compass on axis of coil](imgs/Figure2.1_Wiring_compas_onaxis.jpg)
:::

**Note: The Earth’s magnetic field will orient the compass needle. Remember, this did not occur in previous exercises, because we were dealing with ideal simulations.  Thus we will align the entire apparatus, both the coil and the compass, so that the compass needle is nearly perpendicular to the axis of the coil.**

:::Figure:Video
###Placeholder for Jeremy's First Video
<!-- Raffi Video Notes: The circuit should be set up as seen in the figure. Make sure to have the compass and apparatus oriented correctly with respect to North. Have a ruler set up, probably stuck to the table going from the compass to the coil. Slide the coil along the ruler (meter stick probably) and at various distances press the momentary switch just long enough to get a usable reading. When you get to the final distance put in the iron core, make a note of the orientation of the core, and press momentarily again. Be sure to make all of you switch presses momentary especially when the iron core is in the coil.  -->
![Video 2](imgs/Figure2.1_Wiring_compas_onaxis.jpg)
:::

In Video 2 we see the system from Figure 4, GUAC built and powered. The air core coil will be moved away from the compass. At certain distances, power will be applied for a short time by means of the momentary-contact switch shown in Figure 4. When the coil is at its farthest distance from the compass, an iron rod will be placed inside it. Power will again be applied via the momentary-contact switch.

1. Watch Video 2, and note the difference in how the compass needle behaves when the coil is powered versus when it is not.
2. Note the angle (in degrees) of deflection of the compass needle at three different distances. Pause the video to make these measurements.
3. Note at what distance the needle barely deflects. 
4. At (AVOCADO timestamp) an iron core is put into the coil. Observe what occurs when the coil is powered with the iron core inserted.


::: Question
a) How many degrees does the compass needle deflect when the coil is originally powered at $5\ cm$ away?

b) How many degrees does the compass needle deflect when the coil is $10\ cm$ away? How does this compare to the measurement made at a distance of $5\ cm$?

c) At what distance is the needle&rsquo;s deflection just barely noticeable?

d) How does the needle&rsquo;s deflection change once the iron core is placed into the coil?
:::
:::


::: Note
**Ferromagnetic materials greatly increase the strength of a magnetic field. This is due to the atomic and molecular structures of the material lining up with the externally applied field.**
:::

::: Exercise

This exercise continues our investigation into magnetic field strength. Instead of varying the distance between our compass and our electromagnet as we did in Exercise 3, we will vary the current flowing through our electromagnet. To do this, we add a rheostat &ndash; a variable resistor &ndash; to our circuit, as shown in Figure 5. GUAC By varying the resistance, we can vary the amount of current flowing through the coil. Video 3 GUAC shows the circuit in Figure 5 in operation, with the rheostat being slowly adjusted from zero resistance at the beginning, to maximum resistance at the end. (AVOCADO Redundancies, can be cut down to be more efficiently stated.)

:::Figure:Figure
![Figure 2.2 – Wiring diagram showing rheostat in series.](imgs/Figure2.2_Wiring_rheostat_inseries.jpg)
:::


:::Figure:Video
###Placeholder for Jeremy's Second Video
<!-- Raffi Video Notes: The circuit should be set up as seen in the figure now with the rheostat. Make sure to have the compass and apparatus oriented correctly with respect to North (This is all more or less the same as in the previous video). Have a ruler set up going along the rheostat now. Starting at the 0 position, slide the rheostat head along the ruler  and at various distances (0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1) press the momentary switch just long enough to get a usable reading. Be sure to make all of you switch presses momentary. -->
![Video 2](imgs/Figure2.1_Wiring_compas_onaxis.jpg)
:::

Video 3 GUAC shows a rheostat being used to vary the current passing through the coil. The video begins with the wiper of the rheostat at the $0$ position, and shows it being slowly moved to the opposite end ($1$, maximum resistance).

1. Watch Video 3, which shows the current being changed slowly from maximum to minimum.
2. Note the angle of the compass needle for 5 data points; the rheostat at $0$, $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{3}{4}$, and $1$ positions.
3. Make a table of these data and plot them. 

::: Question
a) How many degrees does the compass needle deflect with the rheostat at each position; $0$, $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{3}{4}$, and $1$?

b) What is the shape of this curve, qualitatively?

c) How does the magnitude of a magnetic field change as you go farther away from the source?

AVOCADO (What questions should be here)
:::
:::

::: Note
**Moving charges give rise to magnetic fields. More current means more moving charges. More moving charges means a stronger magnetic field. By placing a resistance in series with the electromagnet, we limit the current and thus reduce the magnetic field strength.**
:::

## PART 3: MAGNETIZATION

::: Exercise
In this exercise we will explore magnetization and how objects can become magnetized. Figure 6 GUAC shows how our coil is configured. It still has the iron core from Exercise 4 inside.

###Placeholder for Jeremy's Third Video
<!-- Raffi Video Notes: The circuit should be set up as seen in the figure, make sure to have the iron core in the coil. Place a variety of compasses  around the coil with a big one or two maybe. Now press the switch for about 3 seconds and wait for the compasses to return to near normal. They will not go back all the way, but they will go back a little bit. Now remove the iron core making sure to leave the markings on the end visible and waive it near the compasses. After a short amount of time put the rod back in in the opposite orientation. Now press the switch again (for 3 seconds? or momentarily). remove the rod again and move it around the compasses. -->
![Figure 3.1 – Wiring for basic electromagnet](imgs/Figure3.1_Wiring_basic_electromagnet.jpg)
:::

1. Watch Video 4, GUAC and pay attention to the compasses and when the switch is being activated. Pause the video at (AVOCADO, Timestamp)

::: Question
Is the iron core a magnet? Justify your answer.
:::

2. Finish watching the rest of Video 4 GUAC. 

::: Question
Did the north pole of the magnetized rod change? How do you know?
:::
:::

::: Note
**In some materials, the atomic and molecular structures remain aligned after the external field has been removed. As a result, the material itself becomes a magnet. This phenomenon is called *ferromagnetism*. A material that behaves this way is said to be *ferromagnetic*.**
:::

## PART 4: MAGNETIC FLUX AND FARADAY’S LAW

Galvanometers are sensitive current meters. The terminals are connected to a small coil of wire enclosed within a permanent magnet; the coil is mechanically linked to the readout needle. Current flowing through the coil produces a magnetic field, which because of its orientation in the field of the permanent magnet, creates a torque on the needle. More current produces a stronger field and thus greater deflection of the needle. A hairspring connected to the needle balances this torque, and restores the needle to its original position when current is removed.

::: Exercise

In this exercise we will explore laws critical to the study of electromagnetism. We will be using Simulation 3 to explore how a moving magnet produces current in a nearby coil. The simulation shows a system similar to the one described in Figure 7 GUAC. 

:::Figure:Figure
![Figure 4.1 – Lenz’s law setup](imgs/Figure4.1_LenzsLaw.jpg)
:::

1. Examine Simulation 1. You may notice that in Figure 7 GUAC we show a Galvanometer, which measures current, and Simulation 3 has a voltmeter, which measures voltage. As we learned in the Ohm&rsquo;s Law lab, $V=IR$. Thus, for a resistive element such as the light bulb in Simulation 3, we can use these interchangeably for the purposes of this lab. (You may also remember that the current that flows is the result of an induced voltage, often referred to as an *emf*, which stands for &ldquo;electromotive force.&rdquo; We may measure either one as we move our magnet around near the coil.)

:::Figure:Simulation
!(https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/faradays-law/latest/faradays-law_en.html)
:::

2. Bring the north pole of the permanent magnet close to the end of the coil on the right side and note the motion of the voltmeter needle. Experiment with different approach and recession speeds, and note the relationship between the speed and the needle’s deflection.

::: Question
a) Which way does the needle deflect when you move the magnet towards the coil? Which way does it deflect when you pull the magnet away from the coil?

b) What is the relationship between the magnet’s approach speed and the degree to which the needle is deflected?
:::

::: Note
#### Flux

- In part 5 of Exercise 1, you drew lines between the N and S poles of the bar magnet.  These lines represent something called *magnetic flux*. Magnetic flux is a measure of the strength of a magnetic field. The field strength corresponds to the number of flux lines passing (perpendicularly) through unit area.

- For a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to a surface, the (total) flux is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength and the area of the surface.

- For a given area, a greater magnetic field strength yields a greater flux. Lesser field strength yields lesser flux.

- For a given magnetic field strength, a greater area yields a greater flux. Lesser area yields lesser flux.

#### Faraday’s Law

- Consider an area bounded by a loop of wire. If the amount of flux through the area is changing, then a voltage will be
induced in the loop. This, in turn, gives rise to a current. Recall Ohm’s law, Voltage = Current times Resistance. This is what
you’ve just observed.

#### Lenz’s Law

- Lenz’s Law states that a magnetic field produced by an induced current always opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced the current. If the magnetic flux is increasing, current flows in the direction that causes its magnetic field to point in the opposite direction to the increasing flux; it tries to cancel the change in flux. You can determine the direction of the induced current by means of the right-hand rule. If you point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the magnetic field from the induced current (opposite to the direction of the change in flux that is causing it), your fingers will curl in the direction of the induced current. (See the photograph at right, below. The thumb points north.)

- Note: The right hand rule holds that when your right thumb is aligned with the direction of current flow, your fingers will wrap in the direction of the magnetic flux. (They will point north. See the middle photograph below.)

:::Figure:Figure
![Figure 4.1a: F = q v x B. Your pointer goes in the direction of v, middle finger in the direction of b. Your thumb is the direction of F.](imgs/Figure4.1a_RHR.jpg) 
![Figure 4.1b: For a wire, when your thumb points in the direction of positive current flow, your fingers wrap in the direction of the magnetic field.](imgs/Figure4.1b_RHR.jpg)
![Figure 4.1c: For a coil, when your fingers wrap in the direction of positive current flow (look at the windings to determine this,) your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field.](imgs/Figure4.1c_RHR.jpg)
:::
:::

::: Question
a) Magnetic field strength decreases as you get farther from the poles of the magnet. Does the flux through the face of the coil change as you move the magnet? Explain your answer.

b) Why does the meter needle deflect? Is the deflection in accordance with Lenz’s Law? Justify your answer in terms of Lenz’s law and your above answers. (AVOCADO, In need of rewording for the change from Galvonometer?) 
:::

3. Reverse the polarity of the magnet by pressing the button on the bottom right of Simulation 3. Take the magnet to the left side of the coil and repeat the above experiment (step 2). Be sure that the north pole of the magnet is the one facing the coil.

::: Question
Describe what you’ve observed. Comment on the direction in which the meter needle deflects and the relative degree to which it does so.
:::

4. While leaving the magnet&rsquo;s polarity the same as it was in step 3, move it back to the right side of the coil. Repeat step 2 with the south pole of the magnet facing the coil.

::: Question
a) What is different when you use the south pole instead of the north pole?

b) How does Lenz’s law explain this phenomenon?
