<ol type="a">
<li>Lay a blank sheet of paper on the table.</li>
<li>Distribute the small compasses equally around the paper and note the direction each one points. The north pole of the compass is painted red. Most of them will align themselves with the earth’s magnetic field.</li>
<li>Note: The compasses sometimes “stick” in one orientation because of static friction between the needle and the center pin. Lightly tapping the face of the compass fixes this.</li>

<li>Note: The compasses may orient themselves in a seemingly random fashion, there are metal fixtures below the table which cause this. Move your paper to a location where you do not observe any strong effects.</li>

<p><strong>Moving charges give rise to magnetic fields. More current means more moving charges. More moving charges means a stronger magnetic field. By placing a resistance in series we limit the current and thus reduce the magnetic field.</strong></p>

<p>Galvanometers are sensitive current meters. The terminals are hooked to a small coil of wire enclosed within a permanent magnet; the coil is mechanically linked to the readout needle. Current flowing through it causes a magnetic field which in turn creates a torque on the needle. More current causes a greater field and thus more deflection of the needle.</p>

<h3 id="flux">Flux</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Magnetic flux is a measure of the amount of magnetic field permeating an area.</p></li>
<li><p>For a uniform magnetic field perpindicular to a surface, flux is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength and the area of the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>For a given area, a greater magnetic field strength yields a greaterflux. Lesser field strength yields lesser flux.</p></li>
<li><p>For a given magnetic field strength, a greater area yields a greater flux. Lesser area yields lesser flux.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="faradays-law">Faraday’s Law</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider an area bounded by a loop of wire. If the amount of flux through the area is changing, then a voltage will be induced in the loop. This, in turn, gives rise to a current. Recall Ohm’s law, Voltage = Current times Resistance. This is what you’ve just observed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lenzs-law">Lenz’s Law</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Lenz’s Law states that magnetic fields always fight change. If the magnetic flux is increasing, a negative magnetic field will be induced in an attempt to fight the change. An induced current is associated with the induced field – it is in the direction predicted by the right hand rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: The right hand rule holds that when your right thumb is aligned with the direction of current flow, your fingers will wrap in the direction of the magnetic flux.</p></li>
