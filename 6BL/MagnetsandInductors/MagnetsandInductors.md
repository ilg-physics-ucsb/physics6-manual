## PART 1: PERMANENT MAGNET AND ELECTROMAGNETS

::: Exercise
a) Lay a blank sheet of paper on the table.
b) Distribute the small compasses equally around the paper and note the direction each one points. The north pole of the compass is painted red. Most of them will align themselves with the earth’s magnetic field.
c) Note: The compasses sometimes “stick” in one orientation because of static friction between the needle and the center pin. Lightly tapping the face of the compass fixes this.

![Figure 1.1 – Compasses around bar magnet](imgs/Figure1.1_Companses_around_Magnet.jpg)

d) Note: The compasses may orient themselves in a seemingly random fashion, there are metal fixtures below the table which cause this. Move your paper to a location where you do not observe any strong effects.
e) Place the provided permanent magnet in the middle of the paper. Trace the outline of the magnet. For each compass, draw a small arrow in the direction of its north pole.
f) To double the number of data points, redistribute the compasses about the paper. They should be equally distributed and should not be at any of the original locations. Again draw an arrow in the direction of the compass.

### Air core electromagnet

::: Exercise
a) Get a new sheet of paper. Place coil A in the center and again distribute the compasses about the page. Wire the coil to the switch and battery as shown in Figure 1.2

![Figure 1.2 – Wiring for basic electromagnet](imgs/Figure1.2_Wiring_basic_electromagnet.jpg)

b) Watch the compasses as you depress the switch. The effect is dramatic. The compasses will align themselves with the new field generated by the coil.
c) With the switch still depressed, draw an arrow for each compass. It **is not** necessary to move them to different locations this time.
d) DO NOT change the paper. Reverse the leads running to the coil. This will reverse the direction that current flows.
e) Depress the current switch. With the compasses in the same position, this time draw dashed arrows indicating the direction of the field.
:::

::: Question
a) What happens when you reverse the current?
:::

**Magnetic fields are vectors, meaning that every point in space has a direction associated with it. This direction is defined exactly as we’ve demonstrated above, it is the direction the north pole of a compass needle will point under the influence of the field.**

## PART 2: MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH

### Compass on Axis of the Electromagnet

::: Exercise
a) Wire the coil as shown in Figure 2.1. Use the air core; that is, do not use the iron rod. Put the larger compass on the axis of the coil, about 5cm away.
b) **Note: The earth’s magnetic field will orient the compass needle. Align the entire apparatus, both the coil and the compass, such that the compass needle is nearly perpendicular to the axis of the coil.**
c) Press the current switch.

![Figure 2.1– Shows wiring, also shows compass on axis of coil](imgs/Figure2.1_Wiring_compas_onaxis.jpg)

::: Question
a) How many degrees does the compass needle deflect?
:::

d) Move the coil to a distance of 10cm.

::: Question
a) How many degrees does the compass needle deflect? How does this compare to the measurement made at a distance of 5cm?
:::

e) Continue to move the coil away from the compass. Stop when the needle barely deflects.

::: Question
a) At what distance is the needle’s deflection just barely noticeable?
:::

f) Leave the compass at the same distance. Put the iron core into the space between the windings. Again press the current switch.

::: Question
a) What do you observe?
:::

:::

**Ferromagnetic materials greatly increase the strength of a magnetic field. This is due to the atomic and molecular structures of the material lining up with the externally applied field.**

::: Exercise
a) A rheostat is a variable resistance device. By varying the resistance we can vary the amount of current flowing through the coil. Rewire the setup to include the rheostat, this is shown in Figure 2.2. Set the compass at a distance of 10cm. Keep the iron core in the winding.

![Figure 2.2 – Wiring diagram showing rheostat in series.](imgs/Figure2.2_Wiring_rheostat_inseries.jpg)

b) Set the rheostat to zero resistance. The zero position is when no current is required to flow through the resistive winding (current bypasses the resistor). Increasing the distance which current must travel through this material increases the overall resistance. Press the current switch.

::: Question
a) How many degrees does the compass needle deflect?
:::

c) Move the rheostat head to the 1/4 position. This increases the resistance. Press the current switch again.

::: Question
a) How many degrees does the compass needle deflect?
:::

d) Repeat **step b** for the 1/2 and 3/4 rheostat positions.

::: Question
a) How many degrees does the compass needle deflect for 1/2?
b) How many degrees does the compass needle deflect for 3/4?
:::

:::

**Moving charges give rise to magnetic fields. More current means more moving charges. More moving charges means a stronger magnetic field. By placing a resistance in series we limit the current and thus reduce the magnetic field.**

## PART 3: MAGNETIZATION

::: Exercise
a) Remove the rheostat from the circuit. Leave the iron rod in the coil. Place a few of the smaller compasses around the coil. Note the orientation of the iron rod within the coil.

![Figure 3.1 – Wiring for basic electromagnet](imgs/Figure3.1_Wiring_basic_electromagnet.jpg)

b) Depress the current switch for about 3 seconds. Release it. You will notice that the iron core electromagnet continues to affect the direction of the compasses even with no current flowing. Carefully note the rod’s direction within the coil (using the color coded ends of the rod), then remove it. Move it close to the individual compasses.

::: Question
a) Is the iron core a magnet? Justify your reasoning.
:::

c) Pay close attention to the end which is “north” on the iron rod. Insert the rod back into the coil *in the opposite direction*. Hit the switch again. Remove the iron rod and observe its effect on the compasses.

::: Question
a) Has the north pole of the magnetized rod changed? How do you know?
:::

d) If the above observations are not clear to you, repeat the procedure paying very close attention to the orientation of the iron rod.
:::

**In some ferromagnetic materials the atomic and molecular structures remain aligned after the external field has been removed. As a result the material demonstrates magnetic properties.**

## PART 4: MAGNETIC FLUX AND FARADAY’S LAW

Galvanometers are sensitive current meters. The terminals are hooked to a small coil of wire enclosed within a permanent magnet; the coil is mechanically linked to the readout needle. Current flowing through it causes a magnetic field which in turn creates a torque on the needle. More current causes a greater field and thus more deflection of the needle.

::: Exercise
a) Wire the circuit shown in Figure 4.1.

![Figure 4.1 – Lenz’s law setup](imgs/Figure4.1_LenzsLaw.jpg)

b) Bring the north pole of the permanent magnet close to the end of the coil and note the motion of the galvanometer needle. Experiment with different approach and recession speeds, note the relationship between the speed and the needle’s deflection.
:::

::: Question
a) What way does the needle deflect when you bring it close to the coil? What way does it deflect when you pull it away?
b) What is the relationship between the magnet’s approach speed and the amount of deflection in the needle?
:::

### Flux

- Magnetic flux is a measure of the amount of magnetic field permeating an area.

- For a uniform magnetic field perpindicular to a surface, flux is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength and the area of the surface.

- For a given area, a greater magnetic field strength yields a greaterflux. Lesser field strength yields lesser flux.

- For a given magnetic field strength, a greater area yields a greater flux. Lesser area yields lesser flux.

### Faraday’s Law

- Consider an area bounded by a loop of wire. If the amount of flux through the area is changing, then a voltage will be
induced in the loop. This, in turn, gives rise to a current. Recall Ohm’s law, Voltage = Current times Resistance. This is what
you’ve just observed.

### Lenz’s Law

- Lenz’s Law states that magnetic fields always fight change. If the magnetic flux is increasing, a negative magnetic field will be induced in an attempt to fight the change. An induced current is associated with the induced field – it is in the direction predicted by the right hand rule.

- Note: The right hand rule holds that when your right thumb is aligned with the direction of current flow, your fingers will wrap in the direction of the magnetic flux.

![Figure 4.1a: F = q v x B. Your pointer goes in the direction of v, middle finger in the direction of b. Your thumb is the direction of F.](imgs/Figure4.1a_RHR.jpg)

![Figure 4.1b: For a wire, when your thumb points in the direction of positive current flow, your fingers wrap in the direction of the magnetic field.](imgs/Figure4.1b_RHR.jpg)

![Figure 4.1c: For a coil, when your fingers wrap in the direction of positive current flow (look at the windings to determine this,) your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field.](imgs/Figure4.1c_RHR.jpg)

::: Question
a) Magnetic field strength decreases as you get farther from the poles. Does the flux through the face of the coil change as you move the magnet? Explain your reasoning.
b) Why does the needle deflect? Is the deflection in accordance with Lenz’s Law? Justify your answer in terms of Lenz’s law and your above answers.
:::

::: Exercise
a) Reverse the leads hooked to the coil and repeat the above experiment. Again use the north pole of the magnet.

::: Question
a) Describe what you’ve observed. Comment on the direction of deflection and the relative amount of deflection.
:::

b) Return the leads to their original position. Repeat **AVOCADO step 2** using the south pole of the magnet.

::: Question
a) What is different when you use the south pole?
b) How does Lenz’s law explain this phenomenon?
:::

c) Insert the core. Bring the north pole of the magnet towards the coil and again goof around with various approach and recession speeds.

::: Question
a) What can be said about the relative amount of deflection? What phenomenon that you’ve already observed help explain this?
