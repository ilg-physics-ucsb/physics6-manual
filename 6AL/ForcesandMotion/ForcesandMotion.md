# Forces and Motion

## PART 1: WHAT IS THE PRECISE MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP GOVERNING THE ACCELERATION OF A MASS WHEN ACTED UPON BY A FORCE?

### Gaining Intuition

If you stand on a skateboard, don't expect any motion to occur until you do something. You must place a foot on the ground and push-off. You observe that you start from rest ($v_{o}$ = 0) and you gain speed as long as you continue pushing. When you stop pushing you stop gaining speed and move at a somewhat constant speed until the combined effects of friction (air and mechanical) bring you to rest.

:::Question
What do you need to do to attain a higher acceleration during the propulsion phase of your motion?
:::

Clearly there are several things that can affect your acceleration. Leg strength, how long your foot is in contact with the ground while pushing-off, and that 55lb backpack, are a few. The three things we are going to look at are acceleration, mass, and force. So, what is the relationship between these values? Perhaps it is $F = m + a$. Or $F = m/a$. Or $F = m^{a}$.

### Procedure

:::Exercise
a) Turn on the air track. Set the pump to Level 3.

b) You should now level the airtrack so as to not impart additional momentum into the cart. The best way to level the track is to use the cart. Adjust the two leveling screws symmetrically to get the cart to stay in the center of the track.

c) Record the mass of the cart, including the glider-hook, using the balance.

d) Place one of the riser blocks under the single centered leg of the air track.

e) Use the spring-driven force meter to measure the force on your car when it is on the inclined air track: first attach the glider-hook to the cart. Thread a length of sewing string around the pulley and attach one end to the cart and the other end to the force meter (Figure 1.1). When finished recording the force, remove the string from the hook attachment.

f) Without changing the height of the air track, ("b" in Fig. 1.2) measure the acceleration of the car. To do this:
1. Measure the distance, L, your cart will travel from the point of release to the bumper at the end of the air track.
2. Release the cart from rest.
3. Using the stopwatch, measure t, the time it takes to travel the distance.
4. Use the kinematics you learned earlier in the quarter to calculate the acceleration from your measured
values of L and t.

g) Repeat steps e) and f) for at least 2 more masses. Use the chrome plated attachment masses in pairs. Increase the airflow to 4 if the cart begins to drag on the track.

:::Question
Does changing the mass affect the acceleration? Should it?
:::

h) Using this height, some trigonometry, and vector analysis calculate the theoretical acceleration on the cart from gravity (assume $g = - 9.8 m/sec^{2})$.
:::

To get to the acceleration, θ must first be determined. The angle θ can be obtained by using b and D, where b is the height of the block and D is the distance between the airtrack's legs. Once θ has been determined, use what you know about vectors to calculate the acceleration.

:::Question
How does this number compare to what you measured earlier for the acceleration?
:::

:::Exercise
i) For two different masses repeat steps d) through f) from Exercise 1 for four different heights. See data sheet at the end of the lab.

j) Using the data from steps d) through g), plot force versus mass.
:::

:::Question
Does the plot appear to be linear? How does the force depend on mass? It might be helpful to
calculate the slope and compare it to your theoretical acceleration.
:::

:::Exercise
k) Now, using the data from step i) in Exercise 2, make 2 plots of force versus acceleration.
:::

:::Question
1. Does the plot look linear? How does force depend on acceleration? Determine the slope for each graph and compare it to the mass used for that plot.
2. Using your answers from Questions 4 and 5.1 write an equation which relates force to both mass and acceleration.
