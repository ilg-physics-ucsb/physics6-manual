# ANALYZING DATA

---

***Make sure to include all tables, plots, pictures, drawings, screenshots or anything else asked of you in the exercises in your report, as well as answers to all the questions.***

***All responses and answers should contain the correct number of sig figs and should include units when needed.***

## Introduction
---

In this lab we will build on some of the concepts from the previous lab while adding some new skills. New topics we will discuss in the assignment are the following:

- What makes a good table.
- How to make a plot.
- How to perform a fit to some data.
- What makes a good plot. 
- Some guidance on how to determine if a plot is linear or not.

## Making a Good Table
In the previous assignment you learned some basics about how to make a table for your lab report. Here we will write down the requirements for any table that you submit. 

In order for the table to convey the data accurately, it must contain:

1. Data organized in columns with descriptive headers that specify variable names and **units**.  If a table must span multiple pages, a header needs to be added for every page.
2. Correct number of significant figures for the data. 
3. All data in a column aligned at the decimal point.
4. If you have any calculations in your table then you should show your work for **one row** of the table.

::: row

::: column

Figure 1 shows two example tables. In the one on the left it, the two variables being measured is clear, the headers have units, it has the proper amount of sig figs, and the decimal points are aligned. 

The one on the right it is not clear what the two column represent. Even if you could determine what the two columns represent, there is no way for you to know the units. Is it seconds and millimeters? Hours and nanometers? Years and feet? 

Your goal with a table, is to communicate what you did as simply as possible to those reading your report. For this class, that means your TA who will be grading your report. If you are clear in your thoughts and your tables, it is more likely your TA will be able to understand any mistakes you make. This will allow them to provide better feedback, and maybe even take off less points. If your TA can't follow what you did, they are more likely to take off points.

## How to make a proper graph
Graphs help us visualize the **relationship between two variables**: the independent variable (on the x-axis) and the dependent variable (on the y-axis). 

An **independent variable** is one that *doesn't* depend on anything else. Often times, but not exclusively, it is a variable that you are measuring directly. 

A **dependent** variable is one that *does* depend on the other variables. Often times, but not exclusively, this is a variable that you get from doing calculations.

Often times in the lab manual we will ask you to plot "this vs. that." When asked to plot something with that format that means plot "dependent variable vs independent variable".

### Steps to Create a Good Graph:

1. Identify the independent and dependent variables
2. Determine the range of each variable.
3. Clearly label each axis with variable name and unit of measurement.
4. Plot the data as a scatter plot. DO NOT "connect the dots."
5. Draw the line of best fit (usually linear).
6. Provide a descriptive titles that communicates the scenario that is being plotted.

When it comes to a title, **don't** provide a title like "Distance vs Time." This is a bad title. This information can be determined from just looking at the axes. Your title should describe what is happening, e.g. "Distance Traveled by Car on Vacation Trip."

:::Exercise

A student measures the relationship between two variables, given in table 5:

:::Question
Identify mistakes with the following graphs

Example 1: Variable range improperly chosen.

Example 2: Missing descriptive title.

Example 3: Axes not labeled, units missing.

Example 4: Dots connected.

:::Note
***Every time your graph contains these mistakes in this or subsequent labs you will be deducted points.***

## Working with a Spreadsheet
Spreadsheets will make your life **MUCH** easier. We highly recommend that you take the time to learn how to use them. It will be a useful skill for all of your Physics 6 lab courses and you may even find it useful in the real world.

### Line of Best Fit

The line of best fit gives you the relationship between the two variables, highlighting the strongest trend in the data. It is determined by the entire data set, which makes it more accurate than only using a single data points. Thus, it reduces experimental errors.

#### How to find the line of best fit:

1.  **Outliers**. These may be due to experimental error or typing the data in the plotting program. Double check them. 

*DO NOT REMOVE AN OUTLIER without a good reason*.

2. The line of best fit is **balanced**, i.e. roughly the same number of points lie above it as below it.

### Slope significant figures
AVOCADO: Add information.


## Using Google Sheets to plot data

Watch the following video that shows how to plot data and find the line of best fit using Google Sheets.

:::Exercise
Use the data set given to you in Exercise AVOCADO, and make a graph. Display the equation for the line of best fit.
:::

## Putting it all together

Watch the following ruler dropping experiment to find the reaction time. AVOCADO: Add explanation of ruler drop.
1. Pause the video and record the length the ruler dropped when it is caught. 
2. Make a table with all ten values.
3. Make a column with the uncertainty in each value.
4. Convert each length to a time knowing that $$length=\frac{1}{2} gt^2$$. Use the appropriate number of significant figures.
5. Take the average of all your measurements.

Note: If you are able to do this with the help of a friend, you can use your own data.
