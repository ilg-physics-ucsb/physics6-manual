# ANALYZING DATA

---

***Make sure to include all tables, plots, pictures, drawings, screenshots or anything else asked of you in the exercises in your report, as well as answers to all the questions.***

***All responses and answers should contain the correct number of sig figs and should include units when needed.***

## Introduction
---

In this lab we will build on some of the concepts from the previous lab while adding some new skills. New topics we will discuss in the assignment are the following:

- How to make a plot.
- How to perform a fit to some data.
- What makes a good plot. 
- Some guidance on how to determine if a plot is linear or not. 

## Working with tables
We compile the data from our measurements in tables. 

In order for the table to convey the data accurately, it must contain:
1. Descriptive title of the table.
2. Data organized in columns with descriptive headers that specify variable names and units.  If a table must span multiple pages, a header needs to be added for every page.
5. Correct number of significant figures for the data. 
6. All data in a column aligned at the decimal point.

## How to make a proper graph
Graphs help us visualize the **relationship between two variables**: the independent variable (on the x-axis) and the dependent variable (on the y-axis). 

### Steps in Drawing a Graph:

1. Identify the independent and dependent variables
2. Determine the range of each variable.
3. Clearly label each axis with variable name and unit of measurement.
4. Plot the data as a scatter plot. DO NOT "connect the dots"
5. Draw the line of best fit (usually linear)
6. Provide a descriptive titles that communicates the

A student measures the relationship between two variables, given in table 5:

:::Question
Identify mistakes with the following graphs

Example 1: Variable range improperly chosen.

Example 2: Missing descriptive title.

Example 3: Axes not labeled, units missing.

Example 4: Dots connected.

***Note: Every time your graph contains these mistakes in this or subsequent labs you will be deducted points.**

### Line of Best Fit

The line of best fit gives you the relationship between the two variables, highlighting the strongest trend in the data. It is determined by the entire data set, which makes it more accurate than only using a single data points. Thus, it reduces experimental errors.

#### How to find the line of best fit:

1.  **Outliers**. These may be due to experimental error or typing the data in the plotting program. Double check them. 

*DO NOT REMOVE AN OUTLIER without a good reason*.

2. The line of best fit is **balanced**, i.e. roughly the same number of points lie above it as below it.

## Using Google Sheets to plot data

Watch the following video that shows how to plot data and find the line of best fit using Google Sheets.

Use the data set given to you in Exercise AVOCADO, and make a graph. Display the equation for the line of best fit.

## Putting it all together

Watch the following ruler dropping experiment to find the reaction time. AVOCADO: Add explanation of ruler drop.
1. Pause the video and record the length the ruler dropped when it is caught. 
2. Make a table with all ten values.
3. Make a column with the uncertainty in each value.
4. Convert each length to a time knowing that $$length=\frac{1}{2} gt^2$$. Use the appropriate number of significant figures.
5. Take the average of all your measurements.

Note: If you are able to do this with the help of a friend, you can use your own data.
