# Energy Transformation

## Gaining intuition

In this lab you will be investigating different forms of energy and how they are transformed from one kind to another. Energy and work are linked by the Work-Energy Theorem. Simply stated, the work done on a particle is always equal to the change in the kinetic energy of the particle. The energy of motion is called kinetic energy (KE). Work is being done. Energy that is stored in the position of a physical system is called potential energy (PE). This is energy that can do work

Loading a stone into a sling shot requires you to do work by stretching the elastic band. At this point the work has been stored as potential energy in the elastic band. When you release the system the stone (which has mass) is accelerated from rest to some final speed as the elastic band breaks contact with the stone. Now the potential (stored) energy has been transformed to kinetic energy. The maximum energy the ball can have is the potential energy stored in the elastic band provided by the operator of the sling shot.

$$
PE + KE = Total Energy
$$

The total energy in a closed system remains constant.
:::

In the case of our sling shot, after pulling the mass back, the total energy is completely potential energy, the kinetic energy is zero because the mass is not yet moving. Next, vision the release in slow-mo. The elastic starts to push on the mass. The mass now has speed and hence kinetic energy. 

::: Question
Where did the kinetic energy come from?
:::

Notice as the kinetic energy starts to increase the potential energy decreases by the same amount. The sum of the two energies must total the starting energy, in this case the potential energy stored in the elastic band. 

## Procedure
:::Exercise

1.) Fire up the air-track. Set the knob to 3. Check the level of the track as you did in the previous lab. 

2.) Attach the Ranger to the calculator. See Appendix A for operating instructions for the sonic ranger.

3) Place a small riser block under the single stand-alone leg of the air track. Measure the height, b, of the block and record this in your lab book. Also, measure and record the mass of your glider cart.

4) Start the glider (with attached metal reflector) at the bottom of the track and give it a quick push up the ramp (air- track). Do not push the glider-cart all the way up the ramp because the rangefinder has trouble measuring objects within 50cm of its sensor. Use the rangefinder to measure the position and speed of the cart as a function of time. 

5) Using the data acquired from the rangefinder and the provided mathematical formulae, fill in the table, which represents the potential energy and kinetic energy of your cart for different times during one cycle (each cycle begins and ends when the car returns to its starting position (at the band) after launch. Make a table that includes the following information: (Note: your data table might look like the one at the end of the lab.) 

(a) Record numerical data from the calculator for at least 10 data points of a single run. 

(b) Use (roughly) evenly spaced data points. 

(c) Include the point where the glider reached its maximum height. 

(d) Include the point when the speed was maximum, you will need to look at your v vs. t graph to get this.
:::

::: Question
a.) Does your data support the Law of Conservation of Energy? 

b.) Identify some sources of error and suggest how you could eliminate them.

c.) When the glider hits the rubber band, what are the kinetic and potential energies right when the glider changes direction? Where did the energy go?

## Lab 3 Math Sheet

Gravitational potential energy is given by: 

$$
PE = mgh
$$

where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity $(9.8 m/s^2)$, and h is the height the object falls. 

Kinetic energy is given by: 

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 
$$

where m is the mass and v is the speed. The constant $\frac{1}{2}$ arises during a mathematical process.

The angle $\theta$ satisfies

$$
sin(\theta) = \frac{b}{D} 
$$

and

$$
sin(\theta) = \frac{h}{R – r} 
$$

Hence

$$
h = \frac{b(R – r)}
{D}
$$

On the air track, the distance D is 100 cm and the distance R is 200 cm. The distance r you will get from the range finder is the distance from the range finder to the car.
