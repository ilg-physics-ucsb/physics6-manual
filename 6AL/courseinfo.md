## Overview

Welcome to PHYS6AL! 

## Required Materials


- A computer with an internet connection will be needed in order to utilize Google Suite as well as access the lab material.
- The Physics 6AL-6BL-6CL lab manual, 5th (2018) edition, is no longer required.





## Schedule

Labs will be available Mondays at noon and due Tuesdays at 11:59pm.
This is **regardless of section**, to ensure everyone has access to the material for the same amount of time.
You should start working on your lab as soon as it is released. A late lab report will incur a 20% penalty, with an additional 20% penalty each additional 24 hours it is late. After 3 days (the respective Friday at 11:59 pm), the report will not be accepted. 

:::Note
A penalty of 20% of the lab grade will be applied per day late up until 3 days late.

### Excused Absence:
If you think you have a valid reason for being absent it is strongly encouraged that you reach out to your TA prior to your section with your reason for absence.
If you have an unexpected emergency (health, fire, power outage, etc) that is preventing you from coming to class please email your TA as soon as you can.
For either case, provide any documentation you can to explain your reasoning.
Doing the above three things makes it more likely that your excuse will be accepted.

Valid reasons include include but not limited to:
- Severe illness.
- Caring for someone with COVID.
- Unexpected power outage, internet outage, gas leak, fire, etc.

Not Valid Reasons Include but not limited to:
- "I forgot"
- "I was sleeping"
