# Acceleration, Mass and Force

## Gaining Intuition

If you stand on a skateboard, don&rsquo;t expect any motion to occur until you do something. You must place a foot on the ground and push off, and thus you will gain speed (accelerate). When you stop pushing, you stop accelerating and move at a somewhat constant speed until friction forces (air and mechanical) bring you to rest.

What affects  your acceleration is your leg strength, which determines the magnitude of the **force** you apply, and that 55-lb backpack, otherwise, your total **mass**.


In this experiment, we will observe the motion of a glider sliding on an inclined air track under the influence of gravity. We will measure the *mass* of the glider, the *force* acting on the glider along the track, and, by timing the motion of the glider, its *acceleration*. 

We will then figure out what the relationship is among these quantities. Perhaps it is $F = m + a$. Or $F = m/a$. Or $F = m^{a}$. Or perhaps it is something else. We will see.


## Procedure

:::

Figure 1 shows a schematic of the air track as it will be set up for this experiment. In order to demonstrate the effects of force while minimizing friction, the air track has lines of holes drilled along the top faces. A pump blows air into the track, which exits through the holes, providing a cushion on which the glider hovers along the track, virtually eliminating sliding friction. The track is tilted to an angle $\theta$ by the insertion of a block of height $b$ under one leg of the track. 

::::::Exercise

In this exercise we want to explore how the mass, $$m$$, of the glider relates to the force, $$F$$, exerted on it by gravity ***along the track***. As you know, the force due to gravity is vertical, but** we are interested only in the component along the track, since that is the one that generates the motion**.

1. Use the template provided to record your data.
<!-- 1. Make a table like the one below, in which to record your data. -->

-  The glider will be released three times, each time with a different mass. The angle of the air track will be constant across the three runs.
 - The distance, $D$, between the legs of the track is 100 cm.
 - The height $b$ is 7.6 cm.
- The distance the glider will travel for each run, $L$, will be 140 cm.
- The mass, $m$, of the glider with the reflector plate is 188.9 g. We can attach up to four slugs (in pairs) to the glider  to increase its mass (to 289.9 or 390.4 g).


 The following video shows the experiment.

:::

2.  Use the spring scale shown in the video to measure the force, $$F$$, along the track for each mass. Record the force values in your table. 
We release the glider from the top of the track, and record the time for the glider to travel from the start (indicated by a red marker on the video) to when it hits the elastic bumper at the bottom end of the track (indicated by a second red marker on the video). 
3. For each run, use the kinematics you learned earlier in the quarter to calculate the acceleration from your measured values of $L$ and  $t$ (Hint: Use $$x=x_0+v_ot+\frac{1}{2} a t^2$$, where $$x$$ is the coordinate along the air track).

::: Question
a. Does changing the mass of the glider affect the acceleration? 

b. What is the average acceleration you find (across the three runs) for this particular incline?
:::

3. Using the height b, leg span, D, and some trigonometry, determine $\sin{\theta}$.
4. The acceleration along the track is the component of the acceleration due to gravity, $$g$$, along the track. The accepted value (to two sig figs) of $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$.
Calculate the glider's acceleration $$a$$ from the value of $$g$$ and $$\sin{\theta}$$ (Hint: check that your expression has units of acceleration, i.e. $m/s^2$)

::: Question
Find the percent discrepancy between the acceleration $$a$$ you found by trigonometry (using $g$ and $\sin{\theta}$) and the average acceleration you found from kinematics (Question 1b.).
:::
5. Now, from the data in your table, plot force vs. mass. The plot should be linear. Find and plot the line of best fit.


::: Question
What  is the slope of the line of best fit? Compare it to your theoretical acceleration. 
:::

::::::





::::::Exercise
In this exercise we want to explore how the acceleration $$a$$ of the glider relates to the force $$F$$ exerted on it. Thus, we will keep the mass of the glider constant, and we will take four runs, each with the track at a different angle. The different incline angles will generate different accelerations along the track. As we did before, we will measure the force on the cart before each run.

1. Record the heights, forces, and mass given above. The forces will be given below. For each run, derive the acceleration from the kinematics equation. Use the template given in Exercise 1 (linked below for convenience).

# Energy Transformation
## Gaining Intuition
In this part of the lab you will be investigating the transformation of energy from one form to another, namely a transformation between potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE). Potential energy is stored energy, for example the energy in a compressed spring, or the gravitational potential energy that an object has by virtue of its height above the ground. Kinetic energy is energy of motion. A mass, having been flung upward, has kinetic energy. When an object is dropped from some height above the ground, gravity accelerates it downward, converting its initial potential energy into kinetic energy as it falls to the ground. 

In the example of the object being dropped from rest, the mass starts out with zero kinetic energy. The force of gravity does work on the mass, thus giving it kinetic energy. This would suggest that work and energy are equivalent. Indeed, the Work-Energy Theorem states that the work done on an object is always equal to the change in kinetic energy of the object. Work and energy have the same units ($kg⋅m^2/s^2$), which constitute the standard unit of energy called the Joule (J). We will not discuss work in detail, but should note that it is defined as the product of the force acting on an object and the distance over which it acts, hence the aforementioned units.

For another example, loading a stone into a slingshot requires you to do work in stretching the elastic band by pulling the stone back against it. When you have pulled the stone all the way back, the work you have done is now stored as potential energy in the band. When you release the stone (a mass), the band relaxes, accelerating the stone from rest to whatever speed it has attained just as it flies free of the elastic band. Whatever potential energy was stored in the band, which you provided by stretching it, is now kinetic energy of the stone flying through the air.

Our main focus will be a fundamental law of nature called the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that (in the absence of dissipative forces, such as friction),

$$
PE+KE=Total energy
$$

The total energy in a closed system remains *constant*.

## Procedure
The figure below shows the setup we will use for this part of the lab.  We measure the position and velocity of the glider by means of a rangefinder.  We will denote the position of the glider along the track with $x$ and the velocity $v$. Note that the position and velocity change with time as the glider moves along the track. We will set the x-axis to be along the track (with the positive direction up the track), and our origin $x=0$ at the bottom of the track.

:::Figure
![](imgs/Lab3/Figure_1_final.png)
:::

:::::: Exercise 

We will operate the air track in a similar fashion to the way we did in Exercise 2.We will place a block of height $b$ under a leg of the air track. 

- The height $b$ will be 2.0 cm.

- The mass of the glider with reflector plate is 188.9 g.

We will release the glider on the air track, and the rangefinder will follow its motion as it rides back and forth on the track (there is a rubber band at the bottom of the track that causes the glider to bounce back up). 
::: Note
The rangefinder records the position and velocity of the glider **starting at the first bounce (with the rubber band at the bottom of the airtrack) and ending at the second bounce**.  Remember that $x=0$ corresponds to the bottom of the airtrack.

The following video shows this procedure:

Below is a link to the table containing the position and velocity data of the glider.

1. **Copy the data linked in the table above into separate spreadsheet**. 

<!-- You will have to go to the second sheet named &ldquo;Exercise 4 Rangefinder Data&rdquo; (See the tab at the bottom of the Google Sheet web page). Take note of the height b and the mass of the glider with reflector plate given above.

<!-- 2. Use the data in your table to plot the position and velocity of the glider. (Hint: You can do this using the same method you used to plot in the previous lab) -->

2. Calculate the kinetic energy (KE) of the glider from the velocity data. Remember $KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.
3. Calculate the (gravitational) potential energy (PE) of the glider. Remember that $PE=mgh$ where $h$ is the height of the glider. In our case, the height $h$ changes with time, so you will have to find it in terms of $x$ and $\sin{\theta}$. See appendix for more details.
4. Calculate the total energy (PE + KE) of the glider for all given times. 
5. Plot the potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy as a function of time (ideally on the same graph).  

::: Question 
a) Where is the glider when its (gravitational) potential energy is maximum? 

b) Where is it when its kinetic energy is a maximum? 

c) Where is it when its kinetic energy is a minimum?
:::
::: Question

Do your data support the Law of Conservation of Energy? (Hint: What happens to the sum of potential and kinetic energy over the course of the experiment?)

:::
::: Question
 At the bottom of the air track, the glider hits and stretches a rubber band, that causes the glider to change direction. When the rubber band is maximally stretched, the glider's kinetic energy is zero, because it is momentarily at rest.  Since the glider is at the bottom of the air track, its (gravitational) potential energy is also zero.  So the sum of the kinetic energy and gravitational potential energies is zero, yet energy is conserved. Where did the energy go?

<!-- b) When the glider hits and stretches the rubber band, what are the kinetic and potential energies right when the glider changes direction?  -->

<!-- c) Where did the energy from part e) go? -->

::::::Exercise 

Write a brief statement summarizing the mains points of this lab (both parts).

# Appendix
:::Hider Force, Motion, Linear Acceleration Math Sheet
Gravitational potential energy is given by:

$$
\rm PE = mgh
$$

where *m* is the mass, *g* (= 9.8 m/s$^2$) is the acceleration due to gravity , and *h* is the height the object falls. Kinetic energy is given by:

$$
\rm KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

The angle $\theta$ satisfies

$$
\rm \sin(θ) = \frac{b}{D}
$$

and

$$
\rm sin(\theta) = \frac{h}{x} 
$$

Hence

$$
\rm h = \frac{bx}{D}
$$

On the air track, the distance D is 100 cm. The distance $x$ that you will get from the rangefinder data is the distance from the bottom of the track to the glider.
