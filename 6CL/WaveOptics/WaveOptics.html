</header>
<p>When calculating image locations and learning about simple optical devices it is useful to treat light as groups of rays which travel straight until they are reflected or refracted. This is referred to as Geometrical Optics. Unfortunately, light doesn’t behave quite so ordinary when it interacts with things at smaller scales. This is because light is an electromagnetic wave, and as such exhibits all of the properties that other waves exhibit, like diffraction and interference.</p>

<h3 id="theory">Theory</h3>
<p>When light passes through two closely separated slits the rays travel slightly different distances before reaching the screen. These slight discrepancies in distance cause the waves to interfere with one another as shown in Figure 1.1.</p>
<p>The top of Figure 1.1 demonstrates constructive interference, the two waves are in phase with one another and add together forming a bright spot, referred to as a maxima. The bottom of Figure 1.1 shows destructive interference, the waves are exactly out of phase at the screen and produce a dark spot. You can see that constructive interference will happen whenever the path lengths are the same, or if they differ by a whole number of wavelengths. Similarly destructive interference occurs when the path lengths differ by a half integer (1/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc).</p>
<p>The resulting maxima (bright spots) can be described mathematically using the formula for constructive interference <span class="math display">\[d\sin(\theta) = m\lambda\]</span> where d is the slit separation, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle to the screen, m is an integer (0, 1, 2, 3, . . .), and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the wavelength of the light source (see Figure 1.2). The angles are usually very small (the distance from the slits to the screen is much larger than the separation of the resulting pattern) so we can assume that <span class="math inline">\(\sin(\theta)\approx\tan(\theta) = y/D\)</span>, where y is the distance from the central maximum, and D is the distance from the slits to the screen. The interference equation can now be rewritten: <span class="math display">\[\lambda = \frac{dy}{mD}\]</span> It is important to note that the interference fringes are created by the two slits, but there is also a diffraction effect occurring from each individual slit, as demonstrated in Figure 1.2. The diffraction envelope causes a fading and brightening of the interference maxima.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-diffraction-gratings-and-track-spacing-on-a-compact-disc">PART 3: DIFFRACTION GRATINGS AND TRACK SPACING ON A COMPACT DISC</h2>
<p>An array of many slits, instead of just two, is referred to as a diffraction grating. Diffraction gratings are made by scribing evenly spaced grooves on a plastic substrate. These grooves act as slits and the condition for maximum intensity in the interference pattern is the same as the double slit: <span class="math inline">\(d\sin(\theta) = m\lambda\)</span> Because the spacing between adjacent slits is so small, often around <span class="math inline">\(.001mm\)</span>, the interference maxima are far apart from one another. <em>This means that we cannot use the small angle approximation, and must compute <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> using trigonometry.</em></p>
<p>A compact disc is composed of tracks of pits scribed around a disc. The data tracks are close enough together to form a diffraction grating, therefore you can use the interference equation to measure the track spacing on a CD.</p>
