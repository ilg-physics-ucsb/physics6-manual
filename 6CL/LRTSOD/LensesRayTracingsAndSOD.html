<p>In the last lab you studied the bending of the trajectory of a single ray of light at a boundary between two materials, a process known as refraction. The important aspects of refraction are the indices of refraction of the materials and the incident angle the light makes with the boundary.  In this lab we will study the refraction of multiple rays of light emitted from a single source point as they reach the boundary.</p>
<p>A lens is an object that consists of a material of index of refraction <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and two spherical boundaries. The shape of the boundaries are designed such that when multiple rays of light emitted by a single source point pass through the lens, they converge to a unique point, known as the image point. The lens thus creates the image of the source point.</p>
<p>We will consider two common types of lenses, convex and concave lenses. Convex lenses are those which bulge outward in the center with the edge being the most narrow part. Concave lenses are those which are thicker on the outside and thinner towards the center.</p>
<div class="ENumber">
<p>Exercise 1</p>
<div class="Exercise">
<p>In this exercise you will explore the relationship between the curvature of a lens and its focal length. In Video 2 you will be shown three different lenses. It will start by showing you them in profile, this is to display their curvatures. The thicker a lens is at its center the greater the curvature. Next you will see the light source, in this case a ceiling light. This is the object that will be focused by the lens to the paper below. The lenses will be moved up and down until the light is focused. Note the distance between the lens and the paper when the image is focused while considering the lens’s curvature.</p>
<!-- **6CL LRTSOD Video 1 Notes:** Set up camera on a tripod aimed down at a table. In this orientation show three lenses in profile. Now aim the camera up towards your ceiling light to show this is the object we are viewing. Now reposition the camera so you can see a table below the ceiling light and vertical space above it. Take three lenses and move them up and down in this region until you focus them and their varying heights.  -->

<p>When a source is very far away, the image appears at the focal point of the lens. Let’s consider the ceiling light to be very far from the lenses. Thus the light from the ceiling is converging at the focal point of the lenses. The distance between the lens and the focal point is the <strong>focal length</strong>.</p>

        <figcaption>Video 5

<p>An object is some physical entity which either produces light rays of its own (like a light bulb) or reflects them from some other light source (like this text, or your pencil.) The image is a version of the object as it appears after going through some optical device, in this case a lens. In the remainder of this lab we will explore lenses and their relationship to objects and images.</p>
<p>We use ray tracing methods to predict the behavior of a lens. We begin with convex lenses though the same methods apply equally to concave. There are only three essential premises needed to analyze lenses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A light ray entering a lens parallel to the optical axis will pass through the focal point on the other side.</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/fig3_1.JPG" alt="Figure 1" /><figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>A light ray passing through the center of a lens is unchanged. <em>Note that this is only true for thin lenses.</em></li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/fig3_2.JPG" alt="Figure 2" /><figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>3.A light ray passing through the focal point and then through the lens will emerge parallel to the optical axis</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/fig3_3.JPG" alt="Figure 3" /><figcaption>Figure 3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Ray Tracing Method</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pick a point as the object.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw one line from the point and parallel to the optical axis. Once it hits the lens it bends down through the focal point. Be sure to extend it beyond the focal point.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw one line from the point to the center of the lens, extend it until it intersects the first line</p></li>
<li><p>Draw one last line from the point through the near-side focal point and then to the lens, when it emerges from the lens it will be parallel to the optical axis. This line will intersect at the same point as the other two.</p></li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/fig3_4.JPG" alt="Figure 4" /><figcaption>Figure 4</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are two other important cases to consider. When an object is placed within the focal length of a convex lens the image point become negative. A virtual image is formed at the point that the images <em>appear</em> to come from. The ray tracing method is consistent, however note that you draw the line in reverse:</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/fig3_5.JPG" alt="Figure 5" /><figcaption>Figure 5</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Note:</em> As a convention, we always draw from the top most point on the object. Any other point would work equally as well. The top is generally most useful.</p>
<p>A concave lens has a negative focal length and the line from object to focal length actually crosses the lens:</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/fig3_6.JPG" alt="Figure 6" /><figcaption>Figure 6</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Concave lenses do not cause light to converge upon a single point but instead cause it to spread out. Because of this they are referred to as diverging lenses. The focal length of a concave lens is negative. If we incorporate this into our ray tracing they can be analyzed using the same method that was used for convex lenses.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/fig3_7.JPG" alt="Figure 7" /><figcaption>Figure 7</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Real Images:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Light rays actually pass through the image point.</em></li>
<li><em>The image is on the opposite side as the incident light.</em></li>
<li><em>The image can be projected onto a screen.</em></li>
<li><em>The image is inverted with respect to the object.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Virtual Images:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Light only appears to pass through the image point.</em></li>
<li><em>The image is on the same side as the incident light.</em></li>
<li><em>The image cannot be projected onto a screen.</em></li>
<li><em>The image is in the same orientation as the object, we say that it is erect.</em></li>

<p>Exercise 4</p>
<div class="Exercise">
<p>In this exercise you will practice ray tracing on a piece of paper. You will be expected to photograph and attach your work.</p>
<h4 id="convex-lens---object-outside-focal-length">Convex Lens - Object Outside Focal Length</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a sheet of paper and draw a horizontal optical axis. Next, draw a vertical line near the center of the optical axis to represent your lens, then measure out and draw the focal points. Assume the focal length to be 2cm. Pick an object point 6cm away from the lens on the top left-hand side of the paper. Draw the three simple case rays – parallel, through the center of the lens, and through the focal point – and locate the image formed on the other side of the lens.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the image is inverted, at a different distance from the lens than the object, and is a different size than the object. Also note that the light rays converge at a given point. For this reason, convex lenses are frequently referred to as <em>converging lenses.</em></p>
<h4 id="convex-lens---object-inside-focal-length">Convex Lens - Object Inside Focal Length</h4>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Get another sheet of paper and repeat step 1, however instead draw the object point inside the focal length, 1cm away from the lens. Again draw the three simple case rays. Note that this is one of the special cases mentioned above, see Figure 5.</li>
</ol>

<p>What do you observe? Do the lines converge at a given point?</p>

<li>Now trace the rays backwards as shown in Figure 5. You will find that they all intersect at a point on the same side as the object.</li>

<p>When an object is inside of the focal length of a convex lens it no longer converges the light rays to a single point. The image is bigger. Such a set up is called a <em>magnifier.</em> Since light does not actually pass through the point where the image is formed we call it a <em>virtual image.</em></p>

<p>Now that you have become acquainted with ray tracing for a single lens, we can use some more advanced ray tracing techniques. What you will see in this part of the lab is some simple two lens systems. The way that we do a ray tracing for two lens system is simple.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For the first lens, you perform a ray tracing for for the object just like you have practiced so far.</p></li>
<li><p>For the second lens, you use the <em>image from the first lens</em> as the <em>object for the second lens</em> and just do your ray tracing like you have practiced.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The image created by the first lens and used as the second lens is call the <strong>intermediary image</strong>. Performing a two lens ray trace allows you to quickly explore two lens systems.</p>
<div class="ENumber">
<p>Exercise 6</p>
<div class="Exercise">
<p>In this exercise we will explore some of theory of two lens systems. Typically we call the first lens that light passes through the <strong>objective</strong> lens and the second one the <strong>eyepiece</strong>. We will look at a version of the telescope and a compound microscope. Each device uses only two convex lenses but the two devices have very different purposes.</p>
<p>Telescopes are used to look at things very far away, usually things we can’t really change our distance to. Something like the moon, or a very far away mountain. Thus we can treat the object as though it were infinitely far away. Therefore we use the objective lens to make the intermediary image somewhere near where we are, then we use then we use the eyepiece as a magnifier.</p>
<div class="QNumber">
<p>Question 10</p>
<div class="Question">
<ol type="a">
<li>For a telescope, at what point does the objective lens focus the image?</li>
<li>Use your table from Exercise 5 to help answer this part of the question. Why can’t the objective be used as a magnifier?</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, with a microscope we do have control over the object’s position! Thus we can use both the objective and eyepiece lenses as magnifiers. The eyepiece will <em>compound</em> the magnification of the objective. Hence the name of the device.</p>
<p>Below is a simulation that will perform a two lens ray trace for you. Let’s use this to build a microscope. In the simulation light is coming from left and moving to the right.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>By clicking on the point labelled “Object1” you can move the objects position and adjust its height.</p></li>
<li><p>By clicking on the point labelled “f1” you can change the focal length of the objective lens.</p></li>
<li><p>By clicking on the point labelled “S” you can adjust the position of the eyepiece.</p></li>
<li><p>By clicking on the point labelled “f2” you can change the focal length of the eyepiece.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally you can make the simulation full screen if you would like. Also, after clicking in the simulation window you can scroll to zoom in and out.</p>

1. Hold the 200mm lens in your left hand. Lock your elbow to give a full extension (Figure 4.1). Aim your arm with the 200mm lens at something across the room. Now take the 100mm lens and hold it with your right hand. Place the 100mm lens, the eyepiece, right at the back of the 200mm lens, the objective lens (Figure 4.2). Using your right eye, slowly bring the eyepiece, in your right hand, toward your eye (Figure 4.3). Keep your eye, the eyepiece and the objective lens along the same axis pointed at your target. You should be able to capture a clear image of your target. You may find this easier if you shut your left eye.

:::Question
a.) Does the object appear to be closer or farther from you?

b.) How much closer do you appear to be?

c.)How much larger does the image appear to be? Explain in terms of the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece.

This is an extremely basic telescope. The 200mm lens is used to form an inverted image, and the 100mm lens is used as a magnifier to make it look bigger. The 200mm lens is called the objective lens, the 100mm is called the eyepiece.

2. Remove all the lenses except for the 200mm and 100mm lenses. Remove the Ray Table (round disc) from the Ray Table Base and place the Ray Table onto the lab table. Slide the Ray Table Base toward the 20 cm mark. Do not remove the Ray Table Base from the Optics Bench. Place the light box on the end of the optical bench, with a position of 100cm. Orient it such that the target (crossed-arrows) is facing the rest of the bench toward the 0cm end. Place the 200mm lens at 60cm and the 100cm lens at 10cm. Plug in the light box and view from approximately the 0cm mark. See Figure 4.4.

<!-- I cannot get this sim to stay in a window, Setting it up as an image does not work. Setting it up as a link forces you to another page. I have a saved file for it but I do not know how to get it to that, 6CL_Lab2_P1_Test.json. -->
<!-- Sim 1 Text
Simulation 1 shows how lenses act in two dimentions. There are 4 lenses already made with a light source similar to that of the lights in your laboratory. The three on the left are convex and the one on the right is concave. Move the convex lenses around to see how the light passing through them acts. Select a lens and measure the height at which this occurs using the ruler tool, then do the same for two other unlabeled convex lenses. -->
