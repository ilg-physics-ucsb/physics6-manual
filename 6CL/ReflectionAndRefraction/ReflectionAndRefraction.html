<p>The beam in the lower region is the incident beam. The beam in the upper region is the <em>refracted beam</em>. Note that the exiting beams, A through C, bend (refract) away from the normal. This indicates that the refractive index of <span class="math inline">\(n_1 &gt; n_2\)</span>. This figure could represent light coming from water and going into air. The beam (A) is <em>normal</em> when it is perpendicular to the interface boundary. An interface is the layer or region where dissimilar transparent materials meet each other.</p>
<!-- Q1 -->
<div class="QNumber">
<p>Question 1</p>
<div class="Question">
<p>a.) Is there any change in the path of the normal light beam (A) as it goes from the lower region to the upper?</p>
<p>b.) Is the angle of the refracted light beam (look at beam B or C) more or less than the angle of the respective incident beam? What happens as the angle of the incidence increases? (Goes form B to C)</p>
<p>c.) Is there a particular angle that the rays do not behave like rays B or C?</p>
<p>d.) Does light transmit into the upper region when the incident angle is larger than L?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Theory:</strong> When a light ray encounters a boundary between two materials it experiences a change in direction due to the difference in materials’ indexes of refraction, typically denoted as <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span>. The particular physics of this is beyond the scope of this lab, however the empirical results are neatly summarized by Snell’s Law:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n_1\sin(\theta_1) = n_2\sin(\theta_2)\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All angle measurements are from the <em>nearest perpendicular</em> to the ray. Thus a small angle is almost perpendicular to the surface and a large angle is nearly tangent. Note that all angles are less than 90 ̊. As visible light passes through an interface (transparent), some light reflects obeying the laws of electromagnetic propagation and Snell’s Law of reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> typically refers to the material the light beam comes from, <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> refers to the material the light beam goes into. The speed of light depends on the medium in which it is traveling. Light travels at <span class="math inline">\(3.00 \times 10^8 m/s\)</span> in a vacuum and slower within a medium. It is this change in velocity which gives rise to the index of refraction. They are explicitly related by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n = c/v\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the index of refraction, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the speed of light in a vacuum and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the speed of light in the medium. If you know the medium’s index, you know the speed of light in that medium.</p>

<!-- 1. Adjust the ray box to provide one beam of light. Place the semi-circular plastic block in the middle of the ray tracing table.

Measure and record four different angles of incidence and their respective angles of refraction. Be sure your choices of the incident angles produce a reasonable span of values. A selection of values, ranging from 5° to 8°, would be “not a reasonable span.”* -->

<!-- ![TOP VIEW](imgs/top_view.jpg) -->
<!-- Adjust the light source’s grating to emit just one light beam and attach the ray tracing table to the optical bench. You are provided with an oddly shaped block, use the triangular end of the block as a prism.

Shine the beam of white light through one side of the prism (yellow arrow) and observe the light output on the opposite side. Begin with the angle of incidence close to normal and then sweep to a grazing angle.


Try to get the light to pass directly through the prism with no change in direction or offset.

:::Question
Is it possible to get light directly through a prism? Why do you think this is?
:::

Now use the square end of the block. Shine the beam of white light at an angle other than normal and such that the beam is able to leave through the opposite side (see green arrow in figure above).

:::Question
a. What do you observe about the beam on the opposite side of the block? Is the beam able to pass straight through or is there an offset? Is it parallel to the original beam? Why?

b. When the incident beam is normal to the surface are you able to observe the same phenomenon? 
:::

At steep angles you will observe total internal reflection just as you did with the acrylic block. Mess around with the block and prism to see the many possible geometric paths. -->
<p><strong><em>Theory:</em></strong></p>
<p>The index of refraction for a medium is dependent upon the frequency of the light – blue light has a different index of refraction than red light for a given medium.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The angle at which a beam of light is refracted when traveling between two mediums is dependent upon the index of refraction.</p></li>
<li><p>The indexes of refraction are typically frequency dependent for a given medium. A medium will refract one color more than another color.</p></li>
<li><p>White light is made of many constituent colors.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Piecing these statements together we have a tidy explanation for the phenomenon of a rainbow. At each boundary some colors are refracted more than others which results in white light being spread out into its constituent spectrum. This spreading is called dispersion. The second boundary of the prism – plastic to air – is at such an angle as to increase this dispersion. The difference between the Index of Refraction for the lowest frequency and the highest frequency determines how wide of a rainbow you can see. A material with a larger difference in indexes will have a larger maximum width.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="column">
<p><strong><em>SINGLE PLANAR MIRROR:</em></strong> We regularly encounter flat mirrors as well as glass surfaces which act like mirrors. Intuitively you know that your image is standing directly across from you, when speaking in terms of ray tracing we are the <em>object</em> and our reflection is the <em>image</em>. It is easy to convince yourself that this image is formed straight back – that is, normal to the plane of the mirror – and that it is also an equal distance behind the mirror.</p>
<p>The image of any point object in a planar mirror is simply the point straight across at an equal distance. This is the case for any viewing angle, you will see the image “behind” the mirror at an equal distance. The line between the object and image is always normal to the plane of the mirror.</p>
<p>Now lets consider why ray tracing works. The law of reflection tells us that the angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection. We also know that the image is formed by the light ray that emanates from the object, reflects off the mirror, and finally reaches our eye. The ray which reaches our eye must obey the law of reflection, its path is shown in Figure 3.1. It is important to note that this would work equally as well for any set of angles. We see an image behind the mirror because of the law of reflection - if you instead extend the reflected light ray behind the mirror it would arrive precisely at the image point as in Figure 3.1. The phenomenon of reflection fools us into thinking the light rays originate from the image point.</p>

<p>The pink arrow coming off the object indicates a ray of light emitted form the object. When it hits the mirror it reflects off, and this is the blue arrow. That beam will reflect into the viewers eye.</p>

<!-- 1. Set a clean piece of paper on the cork side of the of the corkboard. Place the mirror assembly onto the corkboard as shown in Figure 4.1.

2. The mirror is a second surface mirror, the light actually reflects from the surface behind the clear protective plastic. Place a mark on the paper to locate the reflective surface. Do this at both corners of the mirror (see Figure 4.1). Remove the mirror and draw a solid line connecting the two marks.

3. Replace the mirror to its previous position making sure that the line is still located at the reflective surface.

4. Place a non-yellow pin 6-10 cm from the surface of the mirror, slightly off to one side. This will be the object pin. ***Place the pin as vertical as possible.*** Mark this location with an “O.”

5. Heads up: ***Place pins as vertical as possible.*** Select two yellow pins. Place one of those pins anywhere, approximately 1–2 cm in front of the mirror on either side of the object (non-yellow) pin. Do not worry about this yellow pin’s reflection. Closing one eye, find the position where the head of the one physical yellow pin and the head of the one “virtual” object pin (non-yellow) overlap (coincide). Place the remaining yellow pin in a location such that its head coincides with the other heads. That is, it is in the same line with the first physical pin and the virtual object pin image. See Figure 4.2 The two yellow pins you just inserted now define the reflected light ray. Precisely mark the location of the ray pins (yellows), each with an “A.” Then remove the yellow pins. 

6. Repeat step 5 one more time from a different viewing angle. Mark the location of these pins each with a “B.” 

7. Once you have marked the locations of reflected rays, remove the mirror. For each pair of marks draw a solid line through the two pin holes to the surface of the mirror. Draw another line from the location of the object pin to the intersection of the mirror surface and the line you just drew. Mark the direction of light—from the object pin, to the mirror, and finally to your eye —with arrows on these lines (see Figure 3.1). Extend the line created with the original two pins behind the mirror, making it a dashed line. Repeat this process for the other sets of pins. -->
<!-- :::Question
Where do the dashed lines meet?

8. Now construct a line from the object to the image. Measure the distance from the mirror surface to the object and 
then from the mirror surface to the image location.

9. Construct a perpendicular line at the point where each of the rays intersects the mirror surface (the line at the back edge of the mirror). Measure the angle of incidence and angle of reflection. Neatly tabulate your results for each ray.
