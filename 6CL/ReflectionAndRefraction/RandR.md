## PART 1: REFRACTION
![Figure 1](imgs/fig1_1.jpg)

The beam in the lower region is the incident beam. The beam in the upper region is the *refracted beam*. Note that the exiting beams, A through C, bend (refract) away from the normal. This indicates that the refractive index of $n_1 > n_2$. This figure could represent light coming from water and going into air. The beam (A) is *normal* when it is perpendicular to the interface boundary. An interface is the layer or region where dissimilar transparent materials meet each other.

:::Question
a.) Is there any change in the path of the normal light beam (A) as it goes from the lower region to the upper?

b.) Is the angle of the refracted light (B or C) beam more or less than the angle of the respective incident beam? What happens as the angle of the incidence increases? (B&C)

c.) Is there a particular angle that the rays do not behave like rays B or C?

d.) Does light transmit into the upper region when the incident angle is larger than L?
:::

**Theory:** When a light ray encounters a boundary between two materials it experiences a change in direction due to the difference in materials’ indexes of refraction, typically denoted as $n_1$ and $n_2$. The particular physics of this is beyond the scope of this lab, however the empirical results are neatly summarized by Snell’s Law:

$$n_1\sin(\theta_1) = n_2\sin(\theta_2)$$

**Note:** All angle measurements are from the *nearest perpendicular* to the ray. Thus a small angle is almost perpendicular to the surface and a large angle is nearly tangent. Note that all angles are less than 90 ̊. As visible light passes through an interface (transparent), some light reflects obeying the laws of electromagnetic propagation and Snell’s Law of reflection.

**Note 2:** $n_1$ typically refers to the material the light beam comes from, $n_2$ refers to the material the light beam goes into. The speed of light depends on the medium in which it is traveling. Light travels at $3.00 \times 10^8 m/s$ in a vacuum and slower within a medium. It is this change in velocity which gives rise to the index of refraction. They are explicitly related by:

$$n = c/v$$

where $n$ is the index of refraction, $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum and $v$ is the speed of light in the medium. If you know the medium’s index, you know the speed of light in that medium.

**Simulation** Let's start by looking at a simulation of what happens when light interacts with a boundary.

:::Exercise

![Simulation 1](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/bending-light/latest/bending-light_en.html?screens=1){width=100% height=600px}

1. The top material should already be set to "Air". Leave it as that. Change the bottom material to "Mystery B".

2. Turn on the laser by clicking the large red button and click on teh grey housing of the laser and move it a new angle.

3. Use the protractor tool to measure the new incident angle and refracted angle

:::Question
What is the index of refraction for the material "Mystery B". Show your work.

4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 above but make the bottom material "Mystery A"

:::Question

**Experiment:** You will use the optical bench in this experiment. Treat the semi-circular acrylic block as an unknown. Our objective is to find its index of refraction. $n_1$ corresponds to the plastic block, $n_2$ corresponds to the air. Measuring both the incident and refracted angles and assuming the index of refraction for air to be $n_2 = 1.00$ we are left with only one unknown, the index of refraction for the plastic, $n_1$. *We neglect the first boundary between air and the acrylic block because the incident beam is perpendicular to the cylinder’s surface.*

In each of the following cases record the incident and refracted angles.

1. Adjust the ray box to provide one beam of light. Place the semi-circular plastic block in the middle of the ray tracing table. Align it with the table’s axis, this will make it easy to measure the incident and refracted angles. *You can then rotate the table, not the block. It’s easy! Measure and record four different angles of incidence and their respective angles of refraction. Be sure your choices of the incident angles produce a reasonable span of values. A selection of values, ranging from 5° to 8°, would be “not a reasonable span.”*

2. Make a table of the incident and refracted angles, compute the block’s index of refraction for each angle. Then compute the average index of refraction.

Algebraically rearrange Snell’s law to find $n_1$ for each of these 4 angles. Compute the average value.

:::Question
What is the average index of refraction for the acrylic block?
:::

3. The *critical angle* is the breaking point between refraction and *total internal reflection* (where no light is refracted, it 
is all reflected. Find this angle.

At the critical angle the refracted light travels along the surface of the plastic block. Thus, $\sin(\theta_2) = 1.0$, or $\theta_2 = 90$ ̊. Plug this into Snell’s law and compute $n_1$.

:::Question
Does this value agree with your previous calculations? By how many percent is it off? Comment on the number of data points in each case and why one experiment might be preferred.
:::

4. Observe the reflected angle when the incident light is past the critical angle
:::

At angles beyond the critical angle no light is transmitted into the air or along the surface of the block. This phenomenon is called total internal reflection

:::Question
What was the speed of light in the acrylic block?

## PART 2: PRISMS & FREQUENCY DEPENDENT REFRACTION

***Simulation***

:::Exercise

![Simulation 2](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/bending-light/latest/bending-light_en.html?screens=2){width=100% height=600px}

1. Start by selecting the white light source instead of the laser. You can find this on the right side of the simulation, is the second row, third option on the right. You will know you have found it because the background will turn black.

2. Press the red button to turn on the light source and drag the half circle prism in front of the incident beam, hitting the curved side first.

3. Do you best to align the prism so that the incident beam passes through the center of the prism.

4. Now you can use the knob at the bottom of the prism to rotate it about the center. Rotate it and watch what happens.

:::Question
Sketch the orientation of the block when the rainbow is most observable. Why do you think this is? (Hint: Is the refraction greater at grazing or normal angles? White light goes in, what comes out?) 
:::

5. Replace the half circle prism with the square prism.

6. Rotate the square prism so that the rotation knob is point straight down.

7. Align the square prism so that beam enters one side of the square prism, and exits on the side directly opposite. 

:::Question
a.) What do you observe about the beam on the opposite side of the block? Is the beam able to pass straight through or is there an offset? Is it parallel to the original beam? Why?

b.) When the incident beam is normal to the surface are you able to observe the same phenomenon? 
:::

:::

![TOP VIEW](imgs/top_view.jpg)

Adjust the light source’s grating to emit just one light beam and attach the ray tracing table to the optical bench. You are provided with an oddly shaped block, use the triangular end of the block as a prism.

Shine the beam of white light through one side of the prism (yellow arrow) and observe the light output on the opposite side. Begin with the angle of incidence close to normal and then sweep to a grazing angle.



Try to get the light to pass directly through the prism with no change in direction or offset.

:::Question
Is it possible to get light directly through a prism? Why do you think this is?
:::

Now use the square end of the block. Shine the beam of white light at an angle other than normal and such that the beam is able to leave through the opposite side (see green arrow in figure above).

:::Question
a.) What do you observe about the beam on the opposite side of the block? Is the beam able to pass straight through or is there an offset? Is it parallel to the original beam? Why?

b.) When the incident beam is normal to the surface are you able to observe the same phenomenon? 
:::

At steep angles you will observe total internal reflection just as you did with the acrylic block. Mess around with the block and prism to see the many possible geometric paths.

***Theory:***

The index of refraction for a medium is dependent upon the frequency of the light – blue light has a different index of refraction than red light for a given medium.

1. The angle at which a beam of light is refracted when traveling between two mediums is dependent upon the index of refraction.

2. The indexes of refraction are typically frequency dependent for a given medium. A medium will refract one color 
more than another color.

3. White light is made of many constituent colors.

Piecing these statements together we have a tidy explanation for the phenomenon of a rainbow. At each boundary some colors are refracted more than others which results in white light being spread out into its constituent spectrum. This spreading is called dispersion. The second boundary of the prism – plastic to air – is at such an angle as to increase this dispersion. The difference between the Index of Refraction for the lowest frequency and the highest frequency determines how wide of a rainbow you can see. A material with a larger difference in indexes will have a larger maximum width.

:::Question
a.) A beam of white light traveling in air is incident on a glass block at an angle of 17 degrees. Use Snell’s Law to compute the refractive angle for purple, green and orange light.

b.) Diamonds have indexes of refraction in the range of 2.4. Why would this lead to more visible rainbows in jewelry?

## PART 3: FLAT MIRRORS

::: row

::: column
***SINGLE PLANAR MIRROR:*** We regularly encounter flat mirrors as well as glass surfaces which act like mirrors. Intuitively you know that your image is standing directly across from you, when speaking in terms of ray tracing we are the *object* and our reflection is the *image*. It is easy to convince yourself that this image is formed straight back – that is, normal to the plane of the mirror – and that it is also an equal distance behind the mirror.

The image of any point object in a planar mirror is simply the point straight across at an equal distance. This is the case for any viewing angle, you will see the image “behind” the mirror at an equal distance. The line between the object and image is always normal to the plane of the mirror.

Now lets consider why ray tracing works. The law of reflection tells us that the angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection. We also know that the image is formed by the light ray that emanates from the object, reflects off the mirror, and finally reaches our eye. The ray which reaches our eye must obey the law of reflection, its path is shown in Figure 3.1. It is important to note that this would work equally as well for any set of angles. We see an image behind the mirror because of the law of reflection - if you instead extend the reflected light ray behind the mirror it would arrive precisely at the image point as in Figure 3.1. The phenomenon of reflection fools us into thinking the light rays originate from the image point.

:::Exercise
***Recipe for Planar Mirror Ray Tracing:***

*Note: Read this. You'll need the information in a moment*

1. Select an object and viewer location

2. Reflect the object over the plane of the mirror.

3. Draw a line from the viewer to the image

4. Draw another line from the rays intersection point back to the object.
:::

## PART 4: REFLECTIONS FROM A PLANE MIRROR

:::Exercise
1. Set a clean piece of paper on the cork side of the of the corkboard. Place the mirror assembly onto the corkboard as shown in Figure 4.1.

2. The mirror is a second surface mirror, the light actually reflects from the surface behind the clear protective plastic. Place a mark on the paper to locate the reflective surface. Do this at both corners of the mirror (see Figure 4.1). Remove the mirror and draw a solid line connecting the two marks.

3. Replace the mirror to its previous position making sure that the line is still located at the reflective surface.

4. Place a non-yellow pin 6-10 cm from the surface of the mirror, slightly off to one side. This will be the object pin. ***Place the pin as vertical as possible.*** Mark this location with an “O.”

5. Heads up: ***Place pins as vertical as possible.*** Select two yellow pins. Place one of those pins anywhere, approximately 1–2 cm in front of the mirror on either side of the object (non-yellow) pin. Do not worry about this yellow pin’s reflection. Closing one eye, find the position where the head of the one physical yellow pin and the head of the one “virtual” object pin (non-yellow) overlap (coincide). Place the remaining yellow pin in a location such that its head coincides with the other heads. That is, it is in the same line with the first physical pin and the virtual object pin image. See Figure 4.2 The two yellow pins you just inserted now define the reflected light ray. Precisely mark the location of the ray pins (yellows), each with an “A.” Then remove the yellow pins. 

6. Repeat step 5 one more time from a different viewing angle. Mark the location of these pins each with a “B.” 

7. Once you have marked the locations of reflected rays, remove the mirror. For each pair of marks draw a solid line through the two pin holes to the surface of the mirror. Draw another line from the location of the object pin to the intersection of the mirror surface and the line you just drew. Mark the direction of light—from the object pin, to the mirror, and finally to your eye —with arrows on these lines (see Figure 3.1). Extend the line created with the original two pins behind the mirror, making it a dashed line. Repeat this process for the other sets of pins.

:::Question
Where do the dashed lines meet?
:::

8. Now construct a line from the object to the image. Measure the distance from the mirror surface to the object and 
then from the mirror surface to the image location.

:::

:::

:::Question
How does the perpendicular distance from the object pin to the line marking the reflective surface (Figure 4.1) compare with the distance from the image to that line?
:::

9. Construct a perpendicular line at the point where each of the rays intersects the mirror surface (the line at the back edge of the mirror). Measure the angle of incidence and angle of reflection. Neatly tabulate your results for each ray. 

:::Question
What can you say about the angle of incidence and angle of reflection for each of the rays?
:::

## PART 5: SPHERICAL MIRRORS

Hold the concave spherical mirror mounted in black plastic holder approximately 1cm from your eye

:::Question
What do you observe? What orientation is the image? By approximately what factor has the image been magnified? Remember that magnification, as the term is used in optics, can mean bigger or smaller. For bigger, the magnification is greater than 1.0. For smaller, the magnification is less than 1.0.
:::

Slowly move the mirror away from you. You will notice that there is a point where it becomes difficult to discern any type of image. You are approximately at the focal point of the mirror when this happens. Continue moving the mirror away from you. 

:::Question
a.) What do you observe? What orientation is the image at this distance? How large is the image?

b.) What happens as you continue to move the mirror away from you?
