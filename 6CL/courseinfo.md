<h2> A Multimeter</h2>
<p> In order to make electrical measurements, you will need to have a digital multimeter. Any multimeter will work, but please note that if your input impedance is lower than 10M$\Omega$, you may have to make corrections in some labs. 
We suggest the 
<a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0842HTN8C/?coliid=I171D8G05V6R0U&colid=130URV13JNMZS&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it'>AstroAI DM130B</a>
which is sold on Amazon for approximately $16, and has an auto-ranging feature. </p>

<h2>Additional Supplies</h2>
<h3> Stong Magnets</h3>
<p> You will need 3 or more strong magnets <b>no larger than 1" in diameter</b>. A 
<a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HRM9NP9'>
variety pack such as these</a> is best, but you can use any strong magnet you can find. Note that you can usually buy a pack of 5-10 magnets for $\$2$-$\$3$ at any hardware store.
</p>


<h3>Long Wire</h3>
<p> Any long (~10ft+), insulated wire will do. You should look for solid 22 or 24 gauge wire. The cheapest we found on amazon is this 
<a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DYHHMYH/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_Tto3FbD4K7AJB'>
magnet wire
</a> and this 
<a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DYHHMYH/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_-Ho3FbTACA38T'>insulated wire</a>. Either will do. Again, this material is usually available quite cheaply at any hardware or hobby store.
</p>

<p> Since these projects are DIY, you will need some miscellaneous household items, including:
<ul>
    <li>Smart Phone</li>
